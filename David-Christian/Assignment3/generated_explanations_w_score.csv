"0","The failure occurs due to a condition check in the conditional clause where it throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero.","53.55","0.43482106924057007"
"1","The failure occurs due to a conditional clause that throws an error when the value of minutes is less than zero, and another check for minuteOffset being less than 0 or greater than 59.","45.43","0.4159693121910095"
"2","The error occurs due to the conditional clause only considering values from 0 to 59 for minuteOffset, while the value range should be -59 to +59.","45.09","0.425581157207489"
"3","The issue lies within the conditional statement which checks if minuteOffset is between 0 and 59, not considering negative values. This causes an error for any input less than or equal to -1.","46.27","0.4577632546424866"
"4","The conditional statement on line 279 is checking if the minuteOffset value is less than zero, but it should also check for values greater than or equal to 59. Therefore, minutesOffset should be checked between -59 and +59.","60.65","0.46184098720550537"
"5","The given negative minuteOffset value (-15) is causing the conditional clause to check for values between 0 and 59, leading it to throw an IllegalArgumentException when passed any offset less than -59 or greater than 59.","34.94","0.4587913751602173"
"6","The conditional clause on lines 279-280 rejects minuteOffset values less than zero or greater than 59, resulting in the exception being thrown when -15 is passed as an argument.","42.04","0.43152594566345215"
"7","The program checks for negative or greater than 59 minute values in the conditional statement, while the comments suggest minutes should be checked between -59 and +59.","52.53","0.3915414810180664"
"8","The conditional clause checks if the value of `minutesOffset` is greater than or equal to 0, but it throws an exception when a negative value such as -15 is passed in. The correct range for the `minutesOffset` should be between 0 and 59.","66.57","0.4522724151611328"
"9","The given error occurs when the value of minutesOffset is less than zero or greater than fifty-nine, as specified by the conditional clause line 279 ""minutesOffset < 0.""","35.61","0.39589381217956543"
"10","The software failure occurs when you pass a negative offset value (e.g., -15) to the method and the conditionals within the method reject any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59, causing it to throw an exception.","59.64","0.41227906942367554"
"11","The error occurs when passing a negative value for minutesOffset, specifically -15 through DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(2,-15). The code checks if minutesOffset < 0 on line 279 and throws an exception (line 280) when the provided argument is less than 0.","44.24","0.43507319688796997"
"12","The code is checking if the `minutesOffset` variable is less than 0 or greater than 59, which results in throwing an exception when negative values are passed for minutes.","42.04","0.43175268173217773"
"13","The software failure occurs when the value of ""-15"" is passed as ""minutesOffset"", which has less than 0, causing an exception on line 280 due to incorrect validation checks in conditional statements at line 279.","44.41","0.4393938183784485"
"14","The error occurs when the value of minutesOffset is less than 0. The code specifically encounters the error on line 279 when it tests if minutesOffset < 0.","57.77","0.45816171169281006"
"15","The code throws an exception when the value for `minutesOffset` is less than 0, but it does not properly consider negative values for both minutes and hours.","44.07","0.4421396851539612"
"16","The given error occurs at line 279 when the minutesOffset value is less than zero, which results in rejecting a negative offset that is not within range (0 to 59).","49.49","0.4625518321990967"
"17","The error occurs on line 279 of the code due to the invalid value passed for minutesOffset, which is -15. The conditional statement checks if the provided value is less than or equal to zero, causing an exception when dealing with a negative offset.","57.61","0.43454039096832275"
"18","The code checks if the value of 'minutesOffset' is less than 0 or greater than 59, which causes an exception to be thrown when a negative offset value of -15 is passed to the method.","52.87","0.4384967088699341"
"19","The code is checking if the value of 'minutesOffset' is less than or equal to zero on line 279, which results in rejecting any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59 and throwing an exception.
To fix this issue, change the condition to minutesOFfset < -59.","55.58","0.5101200342178345"
"20","The code checks if the value of minutesOffset < -59 or > 59, which rejects any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59, resulting in an exception being thrown on line 280.","54.9","0.44428956508636475"
"21","The error is occurring on line 279 due to the value of -15 being passed as minutesOffset, which is less than 0 and out of range for the conditional statement ""if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59)"". The correct values should be within the ranges of -59 to +59.","56.08","0.4479660987854004"
"22","The error is occurring on line 279 due to the value of -15 for minutesOffset, which is less than 0. The conditional statement should check if minutesOffset < -59 or minutesOffset > 59 instead.","55.24","0.47551828622817993"
"23","The error is occurring on line 279 due to the value of -15 for minutesOffset, which is less than 0. The conditional statement should be checked for if(minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) instead of simply checking if(minutesOffset < 0).

Additionally, as per comments above line 279, the valid range for minutes offset is between -59 and 59.","52.9","0.4768403172492981"
"24","The code is checking if the value of minutesOffset < -59 or > 59, but due to the negative value passed as minutesOffset (e.g., -15), it throws an exception as it is out of range.","71.65","0.43571144342422485"
"25","The given value for minutesOffset, -15, is less than 0 and hence the exception Minutes out of range: + minutesOffset is thrown on line 280.","55.58","0.3839583992958069"
"26","The error occurs on line 279 due to the value of minutesOffset being less than 0, which should be within the range of -59 to 59.","70.47","0.4899592399597168"
"27","The error is occurring on line 279 because the variable minutesOffset, which is set to -15, is less than 0. The conditional clause for minutesOffset being less than 0 is throwing an exception as it's not within the valid range of 0-59.","58.62","0.4820108413696289"
"28","The error occurs on line 279 when checking if minutesOffset < 0, which is not within the range of -59 to 59 as intended. The check should instead be for minutesOffset < -59.","72.66","0.5155622363090515"
"29","The issue arises from line 279, where the variable ""minutesOffset"" is checked for < 0 or > 59. However, according to documentation, this variable can be negative in some cases. Therefore, the check should read 'if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {'.","41.66","0.39956703782081604"
"30","The exception is thrown on line 279 due to the check ""if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59)"". The variable 'minutesOffset' should be checked for values between -59 and 59, not less than or greater than 0. To fix this, update the check in line 279 to: if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59). Additionally, note that negative values of 'minutesOffset' are allowed according to documentation.","47.28","0.5128065943717957"
