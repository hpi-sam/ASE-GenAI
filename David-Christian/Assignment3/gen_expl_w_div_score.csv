"14","The issue occurs on line 279 due to the conditional statement checking if `minutesOffset` is less than 0 or greater than 59, while according to the comments, `minutesOffset` should be checked for values between -59 and 59. The variable `-15` throws an IllegalArgumentException as it's a negative value.","0.5042149424552917","4.580002841038926"
"27","The issue lies on line 279, where the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero. Therefore, the variable 'minutesOffset' should be checked for values between -59 and 59 instead of only between 0 and 59.","0.5035262107849121","4.833082597593156"
"26","The error is occurring on line 279 due to the value of -15 being passed as minutesOffset, which is less than 0. The conditional statement should be updated to check for minutesOffset < -59 or minutesOffset > 59 instead.","0.49219679832458496","4.88623787840007"
"2","The error occurs on line 279 due to an incorrect conditional clause that throws an exception if the value of minutes is less than zero. The variable 'minutesOffset' should be corrected to <-59 for it to function correctly.","0.487354040145874","2.371640625257735"
"12","The issue lies on line 279, where the variable 'minutesOffset' is being checked for values less than or equal to 0, which should be between -59 and 59 according to the comments above the method.
A negative value of -15 passed into this function will result in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown on line 280.","0.48478370904922485","4.32970384604211"
"29","The issue occurs on line 279 due to the conditional clause checking if minutesOffset < 0, which causes an exception to be thrown when a negative value (such as -15) is passed for 'minutesOffset'. The conditional should be updated to read ""if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59)"" to correct this issue.","0.4771210551261902","4.839114504639261"
"21","The issue occurs on line 279 due to the conditional statement checking if ""minutesOffset"" is less than 0 or greater than 59. The correct range should be -59 to 59 for ""minutesOffset"".

"23","The issue lies on line 279, where it incorrectly checks if the value of minutesOffset < 0 or > 59. The correct check should be for -59 <= minutesOffset <= 59 to fix the bug.","0.47143083810806274","4.930282425188374"
"15","The issue lies on line 279 where the conditional statement is checking if 'minutesOffset' variable is less than 0 or greater than 59, whereas it should be between -59 and +59 as per the comments above the method.

According to the provided arguments, the 'minutesOffset' value gets set to -15 through the call to DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2,-15). This leads to an exception on line 280 due to minutes being less than 0.","0.4700203537940979","4.561635195390996"
"18","The error occurs on line 279 due to the variable ""--15"" being less than 0. The conditional statement checks if ""minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59"", which results in an exception when the value is negative or greater than 59. To fix this, change the conditional statement to: 'if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {'.","0.462780237197876","4.776838647930921"

"11","The issue lies on line 279, where the variable ""minutesOffset"" is checked for values between 0 and 59. The comment block above the method indicates that minutesOffset should be checked for negative values below -59 or positive values above 59. As a result, any input with a value less than 0 or greater than 59 will cause an exception to be thrown on line 280.","0.45633232593536377","4.181272636240373"
"13","The issue lies on line 279 where the variable ""minutesOffset"" is checked to see if it is less than 0 or greater than 59, causing an exception to be thrown for negative values.
