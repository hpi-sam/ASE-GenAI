Find all messages longer than 100 characters that have been liked by at least 20
people. Only consider messages where at least half of the likes are from people that
are foreign to the message’s creator, with a foreigner being a person that neither the
creator nor any of their friends know. For each message, return the message’s id, the
total number of likes and the number of foreign likes. Sort the returned messages by
the ratio of foreign likes from highest to lowest.

To achieve the desired result, we need to construct a SQL query that meets the specified criteria. The query will involve several steps, including joining multiple tables to gather the necessary information about messages, likes, creators, and friendships. Below is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        fl.foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Explanation of the Query:

    ForeignLikes CTE: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of likes for each message that come from users who are not friends with the message creator. It uses a subquery to exclude the creator and their friends from the count.

    TotalLikes CTE: This CTE counts the total number of likes for each message.

    Messages CTE: This CTE combines the results from the previous two CTEs, filtering for messages longer than 100 characters.

    Final SELECT Statement: The final query selects the message ID, total likes, and foreign likes from the Messages CTE. It filters for messages that have at least 20 total likes and at least half of those likes from foreign users. The results are ordered by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.

Note:

    Ensure that the database schema and relationships are correctly set up for the query to work as intended.
    Adjust the query as necessary based on the actual names of the tables and columns in your database if they differ from the provided schema.

ERROR:  missing FROM-clause entry for table "m"
LINE 13:             WHERE k.k_person1id = m.creatorid

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the alias m for the message table is not available in the scope of the subquery within the ForeignLikes CTE. To fix this, we need to adjust the query to ensure that we correctly reference the creatorid from the message table.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,

        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        fl.foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Changes Made:

    Join with message in ForeignLikes CTE: I added a join with the message table in the ForeignLikes CTE to access the creatorid for each message when filtering out foreign likes.

Explanation:

    The ForeignLikes CTE now correctly references the creatorid from the message table, allowing it to filter out likes from friends and the creator.
    The rest of the query remains the same, ensuring that we still count total likes and filter messages based on the specified criteria.

This should resolve the error and provide the desired results.

m_messageid not messageid

Thank you for pointing that out. Let's correct the column names in the SQL query to ensure they match the schema you provided. The correct column name is m_messageid for the message table. Here’s the revised SQL query:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        fl.foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Key Points:

    The column names have been corrected to use m_messageid consistently throughout the query.
    The logic remains the same, ensuring that we count likes, filter for foreign likes, and return the required results.

This query should now work correctly with your provided schema. If you encounter any further issues or have additional adjustments, feel free to let me know!

also for creatorid

Thank you for your patience. Let's ensure that we use the correct column names for creatorid as well. Based on your schema, the correct column name is m_creatorid in the message table. Here’s the revised SQL query with the correct column names:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        fl.foreign_like_count
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Changes Made:

    The creatorid reference has been updated to m.m_creatorid in the ForeignLikes CTE to match the schema you provided.

Summary:

    The query now correctly references m_messageid and m_creatorid as per your schema.
    The logic remains intact, ensuring that we filter and count likes appropriately.

This should work correctly with your database schema. If you have any further adjustments or questions, please let me know!

## 2.2 - 1.1

Adapt this : WITH All_Likes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        COUNT(*) AS likes
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Foreign_Likes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS likes
    FROM 
        likes l, person p, message m
    WHERE 
        l.l_personid = p.p_personid
        AND l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
        AND p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid UNION SELECT m.m_creatorid

        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    a.likes AS all_likes,
    f.likes AS foreign_likes
FROM 
    message m, All_Likes a, Foreign_Likes f
WHERE 
    m.m_messageid = a.id
    AND m.m_messageid = f.id
    AND m.m_length > 100
    AND a.likes >= 20
    AND f.likes >= a.likes / 2
ORDER BY 
    (f.likes::float / a.likes) DESC; to “For each message, also return the full name of the first foreign person who liked the
message and the time when they created the like.”

To adapt your SQL query to return the full name of the first foreign person who liked each message along with the time when they created the like, we need to modify the existing CTEs and add a new CTE to capture the first foreign liker.

Here’s how you can structure the modified query:

sql

WITH All_Likes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        COUNT(*) AS likes
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Foreign_Likes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS likes
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION 
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
First_Foreign_Liker AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        CONCAT(p.p_firstname, ' ', p.p_lastname) AS full_name,
        l.l_creationdate
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION 
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    AND l.l_creationdate = (
        SELECT MIN(l2.l_creationdate)
        FROM likes l2
        WHERE l2.l_messageid = l.l_messageid
        AND l2.l_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION 
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    )
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    a.likes AS all_likes,
    f.likes AS foreign_likes,
    ff.full_name AS first_foreign_person_name,
    ff.l_creationdate AS first_foreign_like_time
FROM 
    message m
JOIN 
    All_Likes a ON m.m_messageid = a.id
JOIN 
    Foreign_Likes f ON m.m_messageid = f.id
LEFT JOIN 
    First_Foreign_Liker ff ON m.m_messageid = ff.id
WHERE 
    m.m_length > 100
    AND a.likes >= 20
    AND f.likes >= a.likes / 2
ORDER BY 
    (f.likes::float / a.likes) DESC;

Explanation of Changes:

    All_Likes CTE:
        This remains unchanged and counts the total likes for each message.

    Foreign_Likes CTE:
        This counts the number of likes from foreign users (those who are not friends with the message creator).

    First_Foreign_Liker CTE:
        This new CTE retrieves the full name and creation date of the first foreign person who liked each message. It uses a subquery to find the minimum creation date for each message.

    Final SELECT Statement:
        The final query now includes the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message and the time when they created the like.
        The LEFT JOIN with First_Foreign_Liker ensures that we get the first foreign liker information.

Result:

This query will return each message along with the total likes, foreign likes, the full name of the first foreign liker, and the time of their like, while adhering to the specified conditions. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!


## 2.2 - 1.2

[I continued the conversation from 1.2]

For each message, also return the full name of the first foreign person who liked the
message and the time when they created the like.

To include the full name of the first foreign person who liked each message along with the time when they created the like, we need to modify the query to join the likes table with the person table and select the required fields.

Here's the updated SQL query:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count,
        MIN(p.p_firstname || ' ' || p.p_lastname) AS first_foreign_person_name,
        MIN(l.l_creationdate) AS first_foreign_like_time
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        fl.foreign_like_count,
        fl.first_foreign_person_name,
        fl.first_foreign_like_time
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count,
    m.first_foreign_person_name,
    m.first_foreign_like_time
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Explanation of Changes:

    ForeignLikes CTE:
        Added MIN(p.p_firstname || ' ' || p.p_lastname) AS first_foreign_person_name to get the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message.
        Added MIN(l.l_creationdate) AS first_foreign_like_time to get the time when that person created the like.
        The MIN function is used here to ensure we get the first entry based on the creation date.

    Messages CTE:
        The first_foreign_person_name and first_foreign_like_time fields are included in the selection.

    Final SELECT Statement:
        The final output now includes the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message and the time of their like.

This query should now return the desired results, including the additional information about the first foreign liker for each message. If you have any further adjustments or questions, feel free to ask!

How is MIN(p.p_firstname || ' ' || p.p_lastname) the first foreign person isnt it the first alphabetical name not the first based on time stamp

You're correct, and I appreciate your attention to detail. Using MIN on the concatenated name will indeed return the first name alphabetically rather than the first foreign person based on the timestamp of when they liked the message.

To get the first foreign person who liked the message based on the timestamp, we need to use a different approach. We can use a ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank the likes by their creation date and then select the first one. Here’s how to adjust the query accordingly:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        l.l_personid,
        l.l_creationdate,
        p.p_firstname,
        p.p_lastname,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l.l_messageid ORDER BY l.l_creationdate) AS rn
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        COUNT(fl.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count,
        CONCAT(fl.p_firstname, ' ', fl.p_lastname) AS first_foreign_person_name,
        fl.l_creationdate AS first_foreign_like_time
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    LEFT JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid AND fl.rn = 1
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
    GROUP BY 
        m.m_messageid, tl.total_like_count, fl.p_firstname, fl.p_lastname, fl.l_creationdate
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count,
    m.first_foreign_person_name,
    m.first_foreign_like_time
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Explanation of Changes:

    ForeignLikes CTE:
        Added ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l.l_messageid ORDER BY l.l_creationdate) AS rn to assign a rank to each like based on the creation date for each message.
        This allows us to identify the first foreign person who liked the message based on the timestamp.

    Messages CTE:
        The join with ForeignLikes now includes a condition AND fl.rn = 1 to select only the first foreign liker based on the creation date.
        The first_foreign_person_name is constructed using CONCAT(fl.p_firstname, ' ', fl.p_lastname).

    Final SELECT Statement:
        The final output remains the same, but now it correctly reflects the first foreign person who liked the message based on the timestamp.

This should now provide the correct results. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

could you also get the name based on the min creationdate and the messageid 

Certainly! To retrieve the name of the first foreign person who liked each message based on the minimum creation date and the message ID, we can adjust the query to ensure that we select the foreign liker with the earliest l_creationdate for each l_messageid.

Here’s the updated SQL query:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        l.l_personid,
        l.l_creationdate,
        p.p_firstname,
        p.p_lastname,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l.l_messageid ORDER BY l.l_creationdate) AS rn
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),

        COUNT(fl.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count,
        CONCAT(fl.p_firstname, ' ', fl.p_lastname) AS first_foreign_person_name,
        fl.l_creationdate AS first_foreign_like_time
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    LEFT JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid AND fl.rn = 1
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
    GROUP BY 
        m.m_messageid, tl.total_like_count, fl.p_firstname, fl.p_lastname, fl.l_creationdate

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count,
    m.first_foreign_person_name,
    m.first_foreign_like_time
FROM 
    Messages m
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2

dont use rownumber use your first approach that starts like this WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count,
        MIN(p.p_firstname || ' ' || p.p_lastname) AS first_foreign_person_name,
        MIN(l.l_creationdate) AS first_foreign_like_time and then get the name with the date and the meassageid not with min()

Thank you for your clarification. To achieve the desired result without using ROW_NUMBER(), we can first find the minimum l_creationdate for each message and then join back to the likes table to get the corresponding foreign person's name. Here’s how to structure the query:

sql

WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS foreign_like_count,
        MIN(l.l_creationdate) AS first_foreign_like_time
    FROM 
        likes l
    JOIN 
        person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    JOIN 
        message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE 
        p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
TotalLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_like_count
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Messages AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        tl.total_like_count,
        fl.foreign_like_count,
        fl.first_foreign_like_time
    FROM 
        message m
    JOIN 
        TotalLikes tl ON m.m_messageid = tl.l_messageid
    JOIN 
        ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid
    WHERE 
        m.m_length > 100
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    m.total_like_count,
    m.foreign_like_count,
    CONCAT(p.p_firstname, ' ', p.p_lastname) AS first_foreign_person_name,
    fl.first_foreign_like_time
FROM 
    Messages m
JOIN 
    likes l ON m.m_messageid = l.l_messageid
JOIN 
    person p ON l.l_personid = p.p_personid
JOIN 
    ForeignLikes fl ON m.m_messageid = fl.l_messageid AND l.l_creationdate = fl.first_foreign_like_time
WHERE 
    m.total_like_count >= 20
    AND m.foreign_like_count >= m.total_like_count / 2
ORDER BY 
    (m.foreign_like_count::float / m.total_like_count) DESC;

Explanation of Changes:

    ForeignLikes CTE:
        This CTE counts the number of foreign likes and finds the minimum l_creationdate for each message.
        It does not attempt to get the name directly here.

    Messages CTE:
        This CTE combines the message data with total likes and foreign likes.

    Final SELECT Statement:
        We join the likes table and the person table to get the full name of the foreign person who liked the message.
        The join condition AND l.l_creationdate = fl.first_foreign_like_time ensures that we get the correct foreign person based on the earliest like timestamp.

This approach should now correctly return the first foreign person who liked each message based on the minimum creation date, along with the other required information. If you have any further adjustments or questions, please let me know!

### LLM

Do you know how an Postgress Querry Execution Plan looks like?

Yes, a PostgreSQL query execution plan provides insight into how the database engine executes a given SQL query. It details the steps taken to retrieve the requested data, including the methods used for accessing tables, the order of operations, and the estimated costs associated with each step.

You can view the execution plan for a query in PostgreSQL using the EXPLAIN command. Here’s a basic example:

sql

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = 'some_value';

This will return a textual representation of the execution plan. The output typically includes:

    Node Type: The type of operation (e.g., Seq Scan, Index Scan, Join, etc.).
    Relation Name: The name of the table or index being accessed.
    Startup Cost: The cost to start returning rows.
    Total Cost: The total cost to return all rows.
    Rows: The estimated number of rows that will be returned.
    Width: The average size of the rows in bytes.

For example, the output might look something like this:

Code

Seq Scan on my_table  (cost=0.00..35.50 rows=1000 width=32)
  Filter: (my_column = 'some_value')

In this example:

    A sequential scan (Seq Scan) is performed on my_table.
    The estimated startup cost is 0.00, and the total cost is 35.50.
    It estimates that 1000 rows will be returned, with an average width of 32 bytes per row.

For more detailed analysis, you can use EXPLAIN ANALYZE, which executes the query and provides actual run-time statistics:

sql

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = 'some_value';

This will give you real execution times and row counts, which can help in performance tuning and optimization.

Can you try to predict a querry Execution Plan for a given Querry

While I can't execute queries or access a live PostgreSQL database to generate an actual execution plan, I can help you understand how to predict what an execution plan might look like based on the structure of the query and the database schema.

To predict an execution plan, consider the following factors:

    Table Size: Larger tables may lead to different strategies (e.g., sequential scans vs. index scans).
    Indexes: If there are indexes on the columns used in the WHERE clause, PostgreSQL may choose to use an index scan.
    Joins: The type of joins (e.g., nested loop, hash join) can affect the execution plan, especially with multiple tables.
    Filters: The presence of filters can influence whether a sequential scan or an index scan is used.
    Statistics: PostgreSQL uses statistics about the data distribution to make decisions about the execution plan.

Example Query

Let's say we have the following query:

sql

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5;

Predicting the Execution Plan

    Table Size: If the employees table has a large number of rows, PostgreSQL might consider using an index if one exists on department_id.
    Indexes: If there is an index on department_id, the execution plan might use an Index Scan. If not, it might use a Seq Scan.
    Estimated Rows: If the statistics indicate that only a small percentage of rows match department_id = 5, an index scan would be more efficient.
    Output: The output might look like this if an index is used:

Code

Index Scan using employees_department_id_idx on employees  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=10 width=64)
  Index Cond: (department_id = 5)

If no index exists, it might look like this:

Code

Seq Scan on employees  (cost=0.00..35.50 rows=1000 width=64)
  Filter: (department_id = 5)

Conclusion

To accurately predict an execution plan, you would need to consider the specific schema, existing indexes, and the distribution of data in your tables. The best way to get the actual execution plan is to run the EXPLAIN command on your query in your PostgreSQL environment.

WITH All_Likes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        COUNT(*) AS likes
    FROM 
        likes l
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
),
Foreign_Likes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid AS id,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS likes,
        MIN(l.l_creationdate) AS time
    FROM 
        likes l, person p, message m
    WHERE 
        l.l_personid = p.p_personid
        AND l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
        AND p.p_personid NOT IN (
            SELECT k.k_person2id 
            FROM knows k 
            WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid
            UNION
            SELECT m.m_creatorid
        )
    GROUP BY 
        l.l_messageid
)

SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    a.likes AS all_likes,
    f.likes AS foreign_likes,
    f.time,
    CONCAT(p.p_firstname, ' ', p.p_lastname) AS name
    
FROM 
    message m, All_Likes a, Foreign_Likes f, person p, likes l
WHERE 
    m.m_messageid = a.id
    AND m.m_messageid = f.id
    AND m.m_messageid = l.l_messageid
    AND l.l_personid = p.p_personid
    AND l.l_creationdate = f.time
    AND m.m_length > 100
    AND a.likes >= 20
    AND f.likes >= a.likes / 2
ORDER BY 
    (f.likes::float / a.likes) DESC;

To predict the execution plan for the provided SQL query, we can analyze its structure and the operations involved. The query consists of two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and a main SELECT statement that joins multiple tables. Here’s a breakdown of the components and how they might affect the execution plan:
Components of the Query

    CTEs:
        All_Likes: This CTE aggregates the total likes for each message.
        Foreign_Likes: This CTE counts likes from users who are not connected to the message creator and also retrieves the minimum creation date of those likes.

    Main Query:
        Joins the message, All_Likes, Foreign_Likes, person, and likes tables.
        Applies several filters on the results, including conditions on message length and the number of likes.

Factors Influencing the Execution Plan

    Table Sizes: The size of the likes, person, and message tables will influence whether PostgreSQL opts for sequential scans or index scans.
    Indexes: If there are indexes on l_messageid, l_personid, p_personid, and m_messageid, PostgreSQL may use those indexes to speed up the joins and aggregations.
    Join Types: The query uses implicit joins (comma-separated tables), which PostgreSQL will interpret as INNER JOINs. The optimizer will decide the best join strategy (e.g., nested loop, hash join) based on the data distribution and available indexes.
    Filters: The conditions in the WHERE clause will affect the filtering process and may lead to early termination of scans if they can be applied efficiently.

Predicted Execution Plan

While I can't generate an actual execution plan without running the query in a PostgreSQL environment, a possible execution plan might look like this:

Code

Hash Join  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
  Hash Cond: (m.m_messageid = a.id)
  ->  Seq Scan on message m  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
       Filter: (m.m_length > 100)
  ->  Hash  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
       ->  CTE Scan on All_Likes a  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
  ->  Hash Join  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
       Hash Cond: (m.m_messageid = f.id)
       ->  Hash  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
            ->  CTE Scan on Foreign_Likes f  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
       ->  Seq Scan on likes l  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
            Filter: (l.l_creationdate = f.time)
  ->  Seq Scan on person p  (cost=... rows=... width=...)
       Filter: (l.l_personid = p.p_personid)
ORDER BY (f.likes::float / a.likes) DESC

Explanation of the Predicted Plan

    Seq Scan on message: This indicates that PostgreSQL is scanning the message table to find messages longer than 100 characters.
    CTE Scans: The CTEs All_Likes and Foreign_Likes are scanned to retrieve the aggregated likes.
    Hash Joins: The joins between the message, All_Likes, and Foreign_Likes tables are likely to be hash joins, especially if the result sets are large.
    Filters: The filters applied in the WHERE clause will be evaluated during the scan, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in subsequent steps.

Conclusion

To get the actual execution plan, you would run the query with EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE in your PostgreSQL environment. This will provide you with real-time statistics and insights into how PostgreSQL executes the query, allowing you to optimize it further if necessary.

# Reflection

## 1.3

I have not much Experience in SQL Query Development this is also why I didn't use Joins because they scare me I had to google some things and needed quite some time to get the query right. I have some limited experience with ChatGPT which is why I tried to supply it with the context first. I then just gave the LLM its error messages until the querry ran. I then proove read it. When it worked I was satisfied. The Query also looks more structured then what I came up with. The development using the AI was far faster and easier. And in fact I was more certain it was true simply because it was a little more structured. But this could also be due to me proof reading it was faster because I had worked on my own solution before. The tools I used that were not the LLM (Google) offered no automation. The LLM offered a pretty good semi-automation since I only had to paste Errors and proof read once. The LLm provided pretty decent quality code and was basically right on the first try appart from syntax.


## 2.3

Adjusting the code on my own was pretty straight forward. The LLM However did some weird things that didnt work (Produced 0 Results) until I basically gave it the answer... Had I not known how to approach the problem the LLM would have been of no help or would have even generated wrong code unnoticed. The performance that the LLM showed in this step was hindering me more than helping me... It could only be used to integrate a existing idea that an engineer would have to come up with into code. This however would have to get checked by the engineer. The explanations that it provided sounded good but given that it didnt work were kind of useless... Also it completly changed the structure of my own code and made it very simmilar to the thing it wrote (maybe due to the fact that this was still in context) In my limited experience I would refrain from integrating ChatGPT into an itterative querry development process...

## 3.2

The execution plan is not plausible and way to short. This is not bad however because the LLM warned me that this is out of scope for its capabilities while giving me a somewhat possible example that is obviously wrong. I would say that this result would have ben bad without the explanations but the explanations saved the LLM and made the answer very satisfying. It also told me how I would use a different tool to get to a correct answer which I did appreciate. The LLM was not made for this specific task which requires exact deterministic execution of a specifiq algorithm. However the LLM was "aware" that it could not fullfill this task.
