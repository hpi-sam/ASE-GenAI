We iterate from 0 to ""consumed"" and add the number of characters required for that particular code point to our ""pos"" variable. In our case ""consumed"" should be 2; and so we'll have 2 iterations. Our first iteration Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input; pos)) will return 2 since the code point for \uD83D is greater than 10;000 and we need 2 characters to express it. So our ""pos"" variable will become 2. The next iteration we'll invoke codePointAt again with the second argument (""pos"") equal to 2; which throws the exception because ""input"" variable has only indices up to 1. The discrepancy happens because in reality input.length() returns 2 as we only seem to have 2 characters; but charCount(codePointAt(input; 0)) returns 2 for just the first code point since its value is greater than 10;000 and actually needs 2 characters to be represented.",1,2,845EI-3g-3E700,5,Undergraduate_Student,6,21,Male,High School,United States,C#; C++

Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.

According to the web; these classes are from org.jfree.data.time on jfreechart.  The top line of SimpleTimePeriod is public class SimpleTimePeriod implements TimePeriod; Comparable; Serializable. The top line of TimePeriodValue is public class TimePeriodValue implements Cloneable; Serializable so STP is not a subclass of TPV and you are showing us the wrong add method.     The period of the TPV is sent to updatebounds and you likely needed to show us the TPV constructor so we knew which input the period was (0L or 50L).   public TimePeriodValue(TimePeriod period; Number value) {          if (period == null) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Null 'period' argument."");          }          this.period = period;          this.value = value;      }  What we actually have is two longs from STP  public SimpleTimePeriod(long start; long end) {          if (start > end) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Requires start <= end."");          }          this.start = start;          this.end = end;      }  btw; here is the documentation link on the web. Since you are studying tool usage.. thats the tool i'm using. http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/index.html    Your add method seems to want to pass a whole time period (the whole STP) and the number of items-1 (aka 0) in the set of time periods... ok.. calling updatebounds on the whole STP and 0.    we'll also need getMaxMiddleIndex() which is not shown here.  The documentation says ""Returns the index of the time period with the maximum middle milliseconds."" there is only one time period in this set so its gotta be the index of this time period.    Unfortunatly I'm not finding code for TimePeriodValues; just TimePeriodValue and SimpleTimePeriod so I'm unsure what the min and max start indexes are. Really; if one of my students gave me this and asked for help; I'd make them show me the relevant code and have them handtrace thru it. Its rather annoying doing this without the actual code that it calls. I'm stopping.     I think the real issue here is that we are given the wrong support code.",10,4,1471CA8i0C-225,5,Other,15,39,Female,University,US,Python

I think using a different name would make the code more readable; and enable someone maintaining the code to have a better shot at understanding it and fixing it. Perhaps you have to define array to be of type Object instead of assuming it's actually an array of some type like String if you're going to let folks call it with a null array.  Then the cast won't fail; and you can go through further steps to find out IF its class is Array; an then if so you can get the class of the first array object to figure out it's a String.
