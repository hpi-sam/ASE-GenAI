1: Nothing in this method checks that the lower range of value is positive -- therefore a negative number is not sanitized.
2: The calculation of g appears to result in a negative integer value if the parameter value is negative to begin with. Passing a negative g into Color would produce the error and there is nothing in the definition of g that seeks to prevent that. And the calculation certainly looks like it would come out negative in that scenario. Again without understanding the relevance of lowerbound and upperbound; I cannot be 100 percent certain; as a caveat.
3: The color is out of the parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0
