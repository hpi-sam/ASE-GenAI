1: Minutes are set to -15; which is less then 0 and it throws illegal arg exception
2: There is a logical check for if minuteOffset is less than 0 or greater than 59 causing it to throw an exception because the value is out of bounds (negative number)
3: this cause assumes all negative minutes are bad. from the comment; negative minutes are ok when the hours are negative too. the comments specifically say its bad when the mins are negative but the hours are positive. there is a line break in the middle of that part of the comment which could lead a programmer to miss half of the info.
4: The argument -15 is less than 0; which causes the if statement conditional on line 279 to pass. This results in the exception on line 280 being thrown. According to the comment block above the method; minutesOffset should be checked for below -59 or above 59.
5: The variable "minutesOffset" is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279. Any negative value for "minutesOffset" will throw this exception; while the documentation states that "minutesOffset" can be negative in some cases.
6: There may be an issue as it involves not indigenous java
7: This variable contains a value of -15 as set by DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15). Line 279 checks to see if is a valid value; meaning that is between 0 and 59. Since it is not; an exception error is thrown in line 280.
8: In the code there is a check that 0 <= minutes < 60 and the minutesOffset is -15 which does not fall into these prarmeters thus throwing an Exception
9: the variable should be defined as "unsigned int" if we expect it to be always positive
10: the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero
