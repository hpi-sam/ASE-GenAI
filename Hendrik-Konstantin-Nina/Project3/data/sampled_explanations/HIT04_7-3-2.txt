1: From looking at the source code; perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter. You are passing minMiddleIndex; though we are checking for maxMiddleIndex.
2: middle index is returned from this part of the code
3: At line 299; variable "s" is declared which contributes to setting "maxMiddleIndex"
