1: Yes; this is related to the failure (though not where the failure actually occurs). The logic here first checks the array type if it's not null; but because the array is null in our case; it sets "type" to a basic Object type. This value gets passed to copyArrayGrowl() which returns a copy of the array.     The "type" that's set in this line would usually be a backup value in case the array is null; but since the array is both null and the "type" value passed is a basic Object type; the array that's returned is an Object[] array; causing the failure later on.
2: You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null.  It works fine as long as one of the parameters are not null.
3: <?> is not defined.
4: That was my first impression; that the use of generics enforces type; and the copyArrayGrow1 method should return an object of type array; or the code will break. However; I could be wrong.
5: Yes; type gets set to Object when both parameters to add are null which is what causes the ClassCastException.
6: As mentioned before; we need to first verify that array parm is not null before using getClass on it so that there will be an instance that allows getClass to work. If it were me; I would write a simple if statement that's easy to understand.  The use of the : ? type statement is concise I guess; but when you start nesting them like this you're just begging for trouble; or just showing off in my not so humble opinion.
7: new array and copyArrayGrowl are different types; cannot equal each other
8: We are passing Null values
9: well the generic is recognized to be a String type by the jvm but then the type value is Object
10: i think new array value going to be null in this program ; it may be a cause of error
11: I believe the error is likely to be somewhere in this line given that the failure is a class cast exception and this is the line where the classes are being retrieved. I'm not confident in which part specifically the issue is though.
12: I think that the array and string being null is likely to cause a problem in this case.
13: The type variable being used at line 3290 is set up at line 3288. There we see if array and element both are null; then it is set to Object.class. Object classes are not implicitly converted to Strings because this can fail if the Object does not convert directly to a String (it could; but maybe not - thus the fail).    So; you are expecting an IllegalArgumentException from add; but there is no coding of this. You might try throwing an error instead of using Object.class by default. Something on the lines of:    Class<?> type;  if (array != null) {    type = array.getClass().getComponentType(); // if it isn't an array class; fail  } else if (element != null) {    type = element.getClass(); // build the collection on this type otherwise  } else {    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Arguments must not both be null!");  }
14: element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class  -- the object is null so this is returning an Object type.
15: The type should be directly inferred from the Template argument types. The array should be made of the type specified; not the getClass() of either the array or the element.
