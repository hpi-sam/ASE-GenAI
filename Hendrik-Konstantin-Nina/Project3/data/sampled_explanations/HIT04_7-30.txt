1: You want to check for maxMiddleIndex to see if its value makes sense with the updated bounds. However; when calculating the maxMiddleIndex; you use this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex as your index for retrieving the period. This should give you the wrong time span.
2: line number 299-302 should be like below :     long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart()                  .getTime();              long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();
3: s.add method expects one parameter of type timeperiod - in the test; the s.add method is called with two parameters.
4: Error: Could not find or load main class undefined
5: There might be an error that makes the MaxMiddleIndex take the value of the index and cause the assertion failure.
6: Yes; since the method invocations are part of an expression to get the value for variable e where its result impacts the value to set for the maxMiddleIndex variable. But there should be no issue or error on the usage of the method invocations. The error encountered is just a result of an assertion where the expected result is different from the one being returned.
7: I believe that the line should use this.maxMiddleIndex rather than this.minMiddleIndex on line 301.
8: long maxMiddle = s + (e - s) / 2;              if (middle > maxMiddle) {                  this.maxMiddleIndex = index;
9: I beleive the getTime will cause a problem; because you are trying to set s to be variable of type "long"; and getTime is going to return a time value.
10: At line 299; variable "s" is declared which contributes to setting "maxMiddleIndex"
11: s should be defined as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime()
12: You're initializing assertEquals to believe the count will be one; while the actual count is three.  You need to change the 1 to a 3 on assertEquals.
13: You would presumably want the end to refer to maxMiddleIndex.    long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();
14: I feel the expression in e should be changed.
15: There would be an issue cause the function add uses the updatebound with different var type
16: When we are calculating maxMiddleIndex the value to be considered should be   long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();  instead  long e = getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();  is used.  I think changing this value to maxMiddleIndex should work as the mean would be calculated properly.
17: there is no clear invocation of functions
18: At line 301 the argument of "getDataItem" should be "this.maxMiddleIndex" but is instead "this.minMiddleIndex".This call is part of a method that updates bounds for all index variables( "minStartIndex"; "maxStartIndex"; "minMiddleIndex"; etc)and more specifically the section of that code that updates the "maxMiddleIndex". Information that was retrieved using the "getTime" method erroneously retrieved it from the "minMiddleIndex" which led to bounds being updated incorrectly.
19: I'm going to assume TimePeriodValues have a constructor that takes a String and first line is okay. However; I don't see an add method in TimePeriodValues that take a SimpleTimePeriod and a double.  I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.    There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below.  Also; I feel like I'm missing additional code if the output above is returned.
20: The variable e is used in two locations which are both reachable by the program (because both minMiddleIndex and maxMiddleIndex are values that can both evaluate to greater than 0) and it can be changed unintentionally.
21: division with 0 does not work
22: There are errors throughout this code.
23: From looking at the source code; perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter. You are passing minMiddleIndex; though we are checking for maxMiddleIndex.
24: variable "e" is used as a conditional to determine maxMiddleIndex
25: At line 299; it should be "getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex)" instead of "getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex)". As the code is currently written; it compares a possible new maxMiddle against the current minMiddle; when it should be comparing against the maxMiddle on that line and the next line (299 and 300).
26: parameter for s is already set for 3 but expected value 1 so there is an issue
27: In the initialization of e and s; the parameters for getDataItem is this.minMiddleIndex. It should be this.maxMiddleIndex
28: i think; instead of 3.0; we need to put 1.0
29: Is middle defined?
30: line 299 should be:      long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime();    and line 300 should also be corrected; otherwise there will be another assertion failure:      long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();
