1: Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex. Since the assertion fails when checking the MaxMiddleIndex it is likely there is something wrong with the assessor functions or how the value they return is being manipulated.
2: e is referencing minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex on line 301
3: You would presumably want the end to refer to maxMiddleIndex.    long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();
4: There would be an issue cause the function add uses the updatebound with different var type
5: Error: Could not find or load main class undefined
6: s should be defined as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime()
7: At line 301 the argument of "getDataItem" should be "this.maxMiddleIndex" but is instead "this.minMiddleIndex".This call is part of a method that updates bounds for all index variables( "minStartIndex"; "maxStartIndex"; "minMiddleIndex"; etc)and more specifically the section of that code that updates the "maxMiddleIndex". Information that was retrieved using the "getTime" method erroneously retrieved it from the "minMiddleIndex" which led to bounds being updated incorrectly.
8: I'm going to assume TimePeriodValues have a constructor that takes a String and first line is okay. However; I don't see an add method in TimePeriodValues that take a SimpleTimePeriod and a double.  I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.    There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below.  Also; I feel like I'm missing additional code if the output above is returned.
9: using minMiddleMindex there ... ? whoops! maybe if the variable names were less insane and verbose (and the methods less verbose) then they would more easily catch errors like that.
10: low version jdk not support
11: s.add method expects one parameter of type timeperiod - in the test; the s.add method is called with two parameters.
12: The method call on line 299 and on line 301 are being invocated on the wrong object. The object should be "this.maxMiddleIndex" instead of "this.minMiddleIndex".
13: From looking at the source code; perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter. You are passing minMiddleIndex; though we are checking for maxMiddleIndex.
14: i think; instead of 3.0; we need to put 1.0
15: variable "e" is used as a conditional to determine maxMiddleIndex
16: At line 299; it should be "getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex)" instead of "getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex)". As the code is currently written; it compares a possible new maxMiddle against the current minMiddle; when it should be comparing against the maxMiddle on that line and the next line (299 and 300).
17: There are errors throughout this code.
18: In the initialization of e and s; the parameters for getDataItem is this.minMiddleIndex. It should be this.maxMiddleIndex
19: Well; since I cannot see how "getDataItem" is defined within the class; I am not sure if it is throwing that error or not.  Plus; I don't see where there could be a try ... catch block that could throw the AssertionFailedError.  It could be something in the "getDataItem" method or one of the subsequent stacked method calls that are after it.  There is truly not enough code to make a decision.
20: I feel the expression in e should be changed.
