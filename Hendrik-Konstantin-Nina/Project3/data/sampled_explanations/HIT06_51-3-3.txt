1: The problem is that a [-0.] is expected; but not returned. The call to add passes as an argument the string of value that could not be possibly be [-0] as it formerly was a long number; which has no sign on 0. This is the place where the -0. expected might be loss.
2: I believe "E" within the clause is resulting to the failure.
3: I believe that the problem must be in the add method. I do not see the problem in the code that is shown. I think the problem might be in the maybeEndStatement method.
