1: Yes; the variable gets set to -15 through the arguments above. The code specifically encounters the error on line 279 when it tests if minutesOffset < 0; (-15) which is the case; so it throws the error on line 280 : Minutes out of range: with the value provided for that argument -15.
2: This is the argument exception thrown.
3: yep; they are checking if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception; and as -15 <0; it gets thrown. looks like they updated the comments but not the code. and this is why comments are evil liars that can't be trusted!
4: YES. The issue is on line 279 (as I explained in my first question; of which I misunderstood that I was only being asked about the specific issue; not generalized issue). On line 279 the variable "minutesOffSet" is parameterized to throw an exception if it is < 0 or > 59. Line 279 should read "if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {" because now the method can take in the number of minutes as a negative and will allow the method to properly progress to invoke/call further methods such as those asked about in the two previous questions.
5: There is a logical check for if minuteOffset is less than 0 or greater than 59 causing it to throw an exception because the value is out of bounds (negative number)
6: the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero
7: As I seem to have misunderstood the previous question; for the sake of consistency; I will declare Yes; there is an issue BUT No; it is not with the variable "offset". The issue can be attributed to line 279 because the variable "minutesOffSet" is still parameterized to throw an exception if it is < 0; rather it should be: < -59 to correct this issue.
8: The error is stemming from line 279 because the value of -15 for minutesOffset is < 0. The line should be     if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {
9: This conditional will reject any negative minute input; even if the hour input is also negative.
10: Line 279 written as "minutesOffset < 0" makes it clear it's the one throwing the Exception; as the -15 in the minutes spot is clearly less than 0.
11: the variable should be defined as "unsigned int" if we expect it to be always positive
12: In the code there is a check that 0 <= minutes < 60 and the minutesOffset is -15 which does not fall into these prarmeters thus throwing an Exception
13: There may be an issue as it involves not indigenous java
14: You are passing it a negative offset value (-15) and the conditionals are set to reject any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59 and throw a new exception.
15: the offset variable is still zero; making it out of range
16: -15 is less then 0; so it throws IllegalArgumentException
17: Yes ; this conditional clause is exactly the place from where the exception is thrown ; because it is not in valid range of "minutes"
18: this cause assumes all negative minutes are bad. from the comment; negative minutes are ok when the hours are negative too. the comments specifically say its bad when the mins are negative but the hours are positive. there is a line break in the middle of that part of the comment which could lead a programmer to miss half of the info.
19: The variable "minutesOffset" is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279. Any negative value for "minutesOffset" will throw this exception; while the documentation states that "minutesOffset" can be negative in some cases.
20: Yes there could be an issue with the parameters passed it will finally give answer millis out of range
