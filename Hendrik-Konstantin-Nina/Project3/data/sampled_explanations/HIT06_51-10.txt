1: the exp variable not get the value is unusable function so the code not executed allways
2: Yes. The problem is exactly that when we get to line 260 in our code (add(Long.toString(value));); we actually send 0 as an argument to the "add" method; not -0.0; because variable "value" is defined of type long eliminating our .0 portion of the number and automatically converting the remaining -0 to 0; since it's the same thing to the compiler. As a result; 0 is appended to our string; not -0.0.
3: I believe that the problem must be in the add method. I do not see the problem in the code that is shown. I think the problem might be in the maybeEndStatement method.
4: The highlighted if statement relates to the treatment of large numbers; not decimals.
5: I think so; addbstring converts the null message to the String "null" may be I am wrong
6: Correct the while loop. The problem will be solved.
7: add method not preceded by class name or defined above
8: This is on comparison of two obviously non-null strings; for example assertEquals("a"; "b").
9: Could not understand the test case but since most of the processing is happening in this code block so it is probable.
10: I think so there was a syntax error
