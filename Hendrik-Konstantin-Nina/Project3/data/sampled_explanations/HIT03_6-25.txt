1: pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range.
2: The while loop has a potential to be infinite if the array c is null (I believe Java allows arrays of size 0).
3: The pos counter is being incremented in line 89 and line 95 within the while; so it could be incremented beyond the len variable.
4: It might if the position it returns in the string isn't accessible
5: depending on the input; the "pos" could be longer than the length of the input.
6: While I am not sure exactly what this portion of the program is trying to accomplish I believe that there is a high likelihood that it could cause the program to crash.  My thoughts are that on line 95 we are incrementing pos by a value associated with input; and then we are repeating this while an unrelated condition (pt < consumed) holds true.  I think there is a strong possibility this would cause us to step out of bounds on input and get the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException we see in the error.
7: lines 84-97 reference character counts; which seems much more correlated to the concept in the failure of being out of range. It almost seems like the amount should be 0 and that is causing the error.
8: That variable is not correct
9: The error has to be in this block.  There seems to be another translate function defined that takes 3 arguments and returns an int so it's possible the error is in there. It's possible that pos is getting increased too much at line 95 also and the error is occurring at that line.
10: The only place in the code where they are using arrays and dealing with array indexes; high probability of issue being present here
11: On line 85; a recursive call is made to the function with an improper number of arguments and expecting a return value.
12: PT++ Should be PT+
13: The invocation will call to inspect the input at positions that are out of range (pos)
14: Yes
15: Yes; there is an exception with surrogate pairs; so there is an issue in line 95 which deals with surrogate pairs I think. Don't understand Unicode and UTF-16 handling well enough to pinpoint the problem.
16: There is no code to prevent pt++ from exceeding len (where len = input.length();)
17: Think So
18: as pos gets larger; it will go past CharSequence at given (input; pos)
19: I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions; the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds.
20: The input "\uD83D\uDE30" needs to be passed through the Class StringEscapeUtils as well.
21: On line 95; there is a space between pos and += which I feel is the wrong syntax. Instead; it should be pos+=. I suspect this threw an exception.
22: Ok I get it; it is an issue with index numbers being less than the length
23: pt can go out of range of the array
24: If the codePointAt method returns a unicode character value greater than 0x10000; then charCount returns 2; which would be potentially added to pos to create a larger index value than the string length.
25: I'm a little fuzzy on what is going on with this code because I'm not up on all the details of handling unicode but the purpose of this sections seems to be dealing with the fact that in things like UTF-8 sometimes you get characters that are one byte and sometimes 2. Anyway; the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable.    If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero.
