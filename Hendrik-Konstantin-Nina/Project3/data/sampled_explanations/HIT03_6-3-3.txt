1: PT++ Should be PT+
2: I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions; the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds.
3: The only place in the code where they are using arrays and dealing with array indexes; high probability of issue being present here
