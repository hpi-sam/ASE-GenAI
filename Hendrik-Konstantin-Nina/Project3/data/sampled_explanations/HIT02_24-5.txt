1: should be a float number
2: there is an issue with colors in that programme
3: The argument value is checked against the lowerBound and upperBound variables; but the resulting variable v is never used in the code. Therefore; the value being -0.5 in this case results in a negative integer value; which is outside the expected 0 to 255 range for a color.
4: The color is out of the parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0
5: Since the exception seems to be thrown up by Color constructor (seeing message - color parameter outside of expected range); there is a problem with the value of g.
