1: pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range.
2: Yes; there is an exception with surrogate pairs; so there is an issue in line 95 which deals with surrogate pairs I think. Don't understand Unicode and UTF-16 handling well enough to pinpoint the problem.
3: I'm a little fuzzy on what is going on with this code because I'm not up on all the details of handling unicode but the purpose of this sections seems to be dealing with the fact that in things like UTF-8 sometimes you get characters that are one byte and sometimes 2. Anyway; the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable.    If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero.
