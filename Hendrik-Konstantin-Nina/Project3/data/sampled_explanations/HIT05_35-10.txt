1: It doesn't have any logic to make sure BOTH cases don't fail (and thus one can be null.)
2: element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class  -- the object is null so this is returning an Object type.
3: The code is passing the class type as null.
4: We are passing Null values
5: Since the inputs are null; then return is an array of [null]. This cannot be cast to a type String.
6: There should not be T() before the newArray
7: The declaration of newArray fails when it is null as in the example.
8: Same concept here you are trying to cast an object to an array and you are not allowed to do so.
9: Type of the variable "type" may be incompatible
10: You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null.  It works fine as long as one of the parameters are not null.
