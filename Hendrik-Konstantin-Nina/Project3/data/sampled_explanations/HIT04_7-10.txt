1: it not contion in the version of jdk
2: 3
3: There would be an issue cause the function add uses the updatebound with different var type
4: You want to check for maxMiddleIndex to see if its value makes sense with the updated bounds. However; when calculating the maxMiddleIndex; you use this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex as your index for retrieving the period. This should give you the wrong time span.
5: At line 301 the argument of "getDataItem" should be "this.maxMiddleIndex" but is instead "this.minMiddleIndex".This call is part of a method that updates bounds for all index variables( "minStartIndex"; "maxStartIndex"; "minMiddleIndex"; etc)and more specifically the section of that code that updates the "maxMiddleIndex". Information that was retrieved using the "getTime" method erroneously retrieved it from the "minMiddleIndex" which led to bounds being updated incorrectly.
6: Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex. Since the assertion fails when checking the MaxMiddleIndex it is likely there is something wrong with the assessor functions or how the value they return is being manipulated.
7: Variable is different
8: I feel the expression in e should be changed.
9: You would presumably want the end to refer to maxMiddleIndex.    long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();
10: i think; instead of 3.0; we need to put 1.0
