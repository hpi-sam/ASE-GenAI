1: Minutes are set to -15; which is less then 0 and it throws illegal arg exception
2: the offset variable is still zero; making it out of range
3: the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero
4: the code is incomplete. it properly checks for greater than 59 but neglects to take into account if the hours are negative before rejecting minutes for being negative. it would be more correct though not completely to check for less than -59 instead of less than 0
5: Yes ; this conditional clause is exactly the place from where the exception is thrown ; because it is not in valid range of "minutes"
