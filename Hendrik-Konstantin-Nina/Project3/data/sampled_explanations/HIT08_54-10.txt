1: Line 114 was not the correct input
2: ch3 is an underscore; not an A-Z character. These lines of code tell it to throw an error when ch3 is not A-Z.
3: A and Z need to be lower case.
4: The comments say it validates strictly.  There is no Country code ... one could argue it's null I guess.   There are consecutive underscores so ch3 is an underscore and not a Capital Letter so the exception is thrown at line 116.
5: It is checking the 3rd and 4th characters are uppercase. The fourth character is an underscore. Write more descriptive errors next time.
6: The if statement in line 115 is checking the character at locations 3 and 4; which in this case would be the fourth and fifth characters; "_P". It seems to be checking to make sure they are capital letters; which ch3 is not and rather is an underscore. Therefore either ch3 < 'A' or ch3 > 'Z' would return false; prompting the throwing of the IllegalArgumentException.      There are other possibilities for this same exception to be thrown before line 116; but our string should pass those without any issues.
7: The failure occurs during the execution of lines 115 - 116.  In line 113; ch3 is set to be "_".  In the if statement of line 115; ch3 is checked for being less than 'A'; which is false; but it is also checked for being greater than 'Z'; and it turns out that the value for '_' is greater than 'Z'.  Since this is so; this particular if statement executes; and throws out the failure outlined above.
8: they should have specified for each length specifically.
9: The input 'fr__POSIX' is not following the expected format outlined in the javadoc: the fourth character is part of the country code and "must be uppercase" (not an underscore)
10: THERE IS
