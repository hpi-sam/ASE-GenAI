1: ch3 is an underscore; not an A-Z character. These lines of code tell it to throw an error when ch3 is not A-Z.
2: else statement is missing
3: This is kind of a "yes and no" situation.  Yes; the fact that the character in position 3; an underscore; is assigned to ch3 is directly responsible for this string passing the ensuing conditional check and throwing the exception at line 116.    I say it is "yes and no" because arguably this line in and of itself is not an issue.
4: The if statement in line 115 is checking the character at locations 3 and 4; which in this case would be the fourth and fifth characters; "_P". It seems to be checking to make sure they are capital letters; which ch3 is not and rather is an underscore. Therefore either ch3 < 'A' or ch3 > 'Z' would return false; prompting the throwing of the IllegalArgumentException.      There are other possibilities for this same exception to be thrown before line 116; but our string should pass those without any issues.
5: ch3 will have a value (an underscore) that falls outside the range of 'A' through 'Z'
6: code condition at 110 is throwing exception.    if (str.charAt(2) != '_') {                  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid locale format: " + str);              }
7: this is the same problem as last time..... line 115 is not going to like the 4th character being an underscore.
8: ch3 would be "_" which is outside the range on line 115
9: YOU MAY HAVE
10: The input 'fr__POSIX' is not following the expected format outlined in the javadoc: the fourth character is part of the country code and "must be uppercase" (not an underscore)
11: It is checking the 3rd and 4th characters are uppercase. The fourth character is an underscore. Write more descriptive errors next time.
12: Yes. Since the length of the string is not 2; it would proceed to the else block. Within that; it would pass the first if statement without issues but would throw an exception after the second if statement; where ch3 and ch4 are checked. The issue would arise not because of ch4; which would pass (be true); but rather ch3 which it expects to be a capital letter and it is an underscore in the string passed. The exception we receive would be thrown at line 116.
13: The country code is missing. Or rather lines 115/117 are looking at '_P' and the underscore fails the validation.
14: Line 115 invalid case.
15: A and Z need to be lower case.
