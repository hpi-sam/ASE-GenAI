1: I'm a little fuzzy on what is going on with this code because I'm not up on all the details of handling unicode but the purpose of this sections seems to be dealing with the fact that in things like UTF-8 sometimes you get characters that are one byte and sometimes 2. Anyway; the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable.    If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero.
2: Calling the translate method with in it's body .
3: There is no code to prevent pt++ from exceeding len (where len = input.length();)
4: depending on the input; the "pos" could be longer than the length of the input.
5: the for loop is limited up to the value of consumed; while pos is incremented; possibly past the end of input since there are no check conditions.
6: The error has to be in this block.  There seems to be another translate function defined that takes 3 arguments and returns an int so it's possible the error is in there. It's possible that pos is getting increased too much at line 95 also and the error is occurring at that line.
7: The only place in the code where they are using arrays and dealing with array indexes; high probability of issue being present here
8: pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range.
9: The invocation will call to inspect the input at positions that are out of range (pos)
10: Think So
