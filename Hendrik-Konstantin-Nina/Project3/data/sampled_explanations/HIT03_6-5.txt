1: The while loop has a potential to be infinite if the array c is null (I believe Java allows arrays of size 0).
2: If the codePointAt method returns a unicode character value greater than 0x10000; then charCount returns 2; which would be potentially added to pos to create a larger index value than the string length.
3: While I am not sure exactly what this portion of the program is trying to accomplish I believe that there is a high likelihood that it could cause the program to crash.  My thoughts are that on line 95 we are incrementing pos by a value associated with input; and then we are repeating this while an unrelated condition (pt < consumed) holds true.  I think there is a strong possibility this would cause us to step out of bounds on input and get the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException we see in the error.
4: I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions; the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds.
5: pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range.
