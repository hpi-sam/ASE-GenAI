1: The issue is actually with the use of one of the members of the array variable. On line 910; there is no check for whether array[i] is null before array[i] is dereferenced; the second member of the test input array is null; causing the exception to be thrown.
2: The array is not classified correctly
3: the template isn't expecting a null pointer - but that's what is being passed in!
4: I think when it gets to array[i] when I is 1. It references null   So calling getClass() on null will give null pointer exception
5: The second element of our input array is null. When we call the getClass method on null a NullPointerException is raised.
