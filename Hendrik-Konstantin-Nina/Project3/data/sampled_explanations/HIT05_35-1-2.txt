1: I think this could be answered "Yes" or "No" legitimately.  The locus of the problem seems; to me; to be the choice of using a generic here; and particularly how it was typed in line 3288.  So; in that sense one might say that "No" there is not a problem.    However; this line we are examining in this equation; line 3290; does contain the definition of the variable "newArray" which is then able to be assigned the "offending" Object type.  So in that sense; there IS something wrong here with the use or definition of the variable.
