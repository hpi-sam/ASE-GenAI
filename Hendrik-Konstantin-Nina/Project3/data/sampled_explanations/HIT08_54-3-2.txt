1: The input 'fr__POSIX' is not following the expected format outlined in the javadoc: the fourth character is part of the country code and "must be uppercase" (not an underscore)
2: The str variable must be the correct length and start with two lowercase letters; which can be followed by an underscore; two uppercase letters; another underscore; and three lowercase letters. Lines 107 to 126 are validating this with if statements. If the str variable does not meet this criteria; an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. The str varible with a value of fr__POSIX seems to be valid up until line 121 where the if statement checks to see if the 6th character in str in an underscore. Since it is not; an IllegalArgumentException error is thrown with the message Invalid locale format:fr__POSIX
3: The comments say it validates strictly.  There is no Country code ... one could argue it's null I guess.   There are consecutive underscores so ch3 is an underscore and not a Capital Letter so the exception is thrown at line 116.
