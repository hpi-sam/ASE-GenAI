1: Since the exception seems to be thrown up by Color constructor (seeing message - color parameter outside of expected range); there is a problem with the value of g.
2: I'm not sure if this is the issue but the fact that int g is being defined by (int) could be causing some kind of parameter error.
3: The argument value is checked against the lowerBound and upperBound variables; but the resulting variable v is never used in the code. Therefore; the value being -0.5 in this case results in a negative integer value; which is outside the expected 0 to 255 range for a color.
