1: The input 'fr__POSIX' is not following the expected format outlined in the javadoc: the fourth character is part of the country code and "must be uppercase" (not an underscore)
2: This is kind of a "yes and no" situation.  Yes; the fact that the character in position 3; an underscore; is assigned to ch3 is directly responsible for this string passing the ensuing conditional check and throwing the exception at line 116.    I say it is "yes and no" because arguably this line in and of itself is not an issue.
3: ch3 would be "_" which is outside the range on line 115
