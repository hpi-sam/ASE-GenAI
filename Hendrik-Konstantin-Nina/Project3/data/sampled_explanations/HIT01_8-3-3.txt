1: The variable "minutesOffset" is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279. Any negative value for "minutesOffset" will throw this exception; while the documentation states that "minutesOffset" can be negative in some cases.
2: It's because of second line negative value.
3: this cause assumes all negative minutes are bad. from the comment; negative minutes are ok when the hours are negative too. the comments specifically say its bad when the mins are negative but the hours are positive. there is a line break in the middle of that part of the comment which could lead a programmer to miss half of the info.
