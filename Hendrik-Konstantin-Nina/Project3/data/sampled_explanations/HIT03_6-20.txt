1: It might if the position it returns in the string isn't accessible
2: pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range.
3: lines 84-97 reference character counts; which seems much more correlated to the concept in the failure of being out of range. It almost seems like the amount should be 0 and that is causing the error.
4: I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions; the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds.
5: as pos gets larger; it will go past CharSequence at given (input; pos)
6: The input "\uD83D\uDE30" needs to be passed through the Class StringEscapeUtils as well.
7: Checking a character in the string with pos most likely causes an error since the error is a string out of bounds
8: The invocation will call to inspect the input at positions that are out of range (pos)
9: PT++ Should be PT+
10: Ok I get it; it is an issue with index numbers being less than the length
11: Yes; there is an exception with surrogate pairs; so there is an issue in line 95 which deals with surrogate pairs I think. Don't understand Unicode and UTF-16 handling well enough to pinpoint the problem.
12: Think So
13: If the codePointAt method returns a unicode character value greater than 0x10000; then charCount returns 2; which would be potentially added to pos to create a larger index value than the string length.
14: On line 95; there is a space between pos and += which I feel is the wrong syntax. Instead; it should be pos+=. I suspect this threw an exception.
15: the for loop is limited up to the value of consumed; while pos is incremented; possibly past the end of input since there are no check conditions.
16: The pos counter is being incremented in line 89 and line 95 within the while; so it could be incremented beyond the len variable.
17: The while loop has a potential to be infinite if the array c is null (I believe Java allows arrays of size 0).
18: As I said in my previous answer; I'm pretty sure the issue is with one of the Character.codePointAt method calls.  It also would require the "pos" variable to reach the value of 2 to have thrown the error listed above.  I can't figure out any way for the "pos" variable to reach a value of 2 and still execute another iteration of the loop (which might lead to the execution of line 87 and an exception there).  Each time the "pos" variable is changed (potentially to an invalid amount) the continue keyword sends the program back to line 84 where the "pos" value is checked against the "len" variable for validity.    Therefore; it seems that the only place where the exception could be coming from is line 95.
19: While I am not sure exactly what this portion of the program is trying to accomplish I believe that there is a high likelihood that it could cause the program to crash.  My thoughts are that on line 95 we are incrementing pos by a value associated with input; and then we are repeating this while an unrelated condition (pt < consumed) holds true.  I think there is a strong possibility this would cause us to step out of bounds on input and get the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException we see in the error.
20: On line 85; a recursive call is made to the function with an improper number of arguments and expecting a return value.
