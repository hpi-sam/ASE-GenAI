1: At line 299; it should be "getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex)" instead of "getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex)". As the code is currently written; it compares a possible new maxMiddle against the current minMiddle; when it should be comparing against the maxMiddle on that line and the next line (299 and 300).
2: In the initialization of e and s; the parameters for getDataItem is this.minMiddleIndex. It should be this.maxMiddleIndex
3: Error: Could not find or load main class undefined
