1: 3
2: i think; instead of 3.0; we need to put 1.0
3: At line 299; it should be "getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex)" instead of "getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex)". As the code is currently written; it compares a possible new maxMiddle against the current minMiddle; when it should be comparing against the maxMiddle on that line and the next line (299 and 300).
4: In the initialization of e and s; the parameters for getDataItem is this.minMiddleIndex. It should be this.maxMiddleIndex
5: there is no clear invocation of functions
6: Error: Could not find or load main class undefined
7: From looking at the source code; perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter. You are passing minMiddleIndex; though we are checking for maxMiddleIndex.
8: At line 299; variable "s" is declared which contributes to setting "maxMiddleIndex"
9: When we are calculating maxMiddleIndex the value to be considered should be   long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();  instead  long e = getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();  is used.  I think changing this value to maxMiddleIndex should work as the mean would be calculated properly.
10: variable "e" is used as a conditional to determine maxMiddleIndex
11: long maxMiddle = s + (e - s) / 2;              if (middle > maxMiddle) {                  this.maxMiddleIndex = index;
12: middle index is returned from this part of the code
13: e is referencing minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex on line 301
14: line number 299-302 should be like below :     long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart()                  .getTime();              long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();
15: division with 0 does not work
