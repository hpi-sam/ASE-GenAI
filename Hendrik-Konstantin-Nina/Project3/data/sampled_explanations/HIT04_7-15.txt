1: 3
2: I feel the expression in e should be changed.
3: ??!! both s and e are Long!  maybe just me; but this confuses (play with 's')! There is no TimePeriodValues in pgm.  TimePeriodValues s = new TimePeriodValues("Test");
4: You initialise count to 0; then you never change that value. You assert that it is expected to be 1. The method is behaving correctly.
5: Is middle defined?
6: I believe it should be dealing with the maxMiddleIndex
7: using minMiddleMindex there ... ? whoops! maybe if the variable names were less insane and verbose (and the methods less verbose) then they would more easily catch errors like that.
8: I'm going to assume TimePeriodValues have a constructor that takes a String and first line is okay. However; I don't see an add method in TimePeriodValues that take a SimpleTimePeriod and a double.  I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.    There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below.  Also; I feel like I'm missing additional code if the output above is returned.
9: low version jdk not support
10: There might be an error that makes the MaxMiddleIndex take the value of the index and cause the assertion failure.
11: e is referencing minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex on line 301
12: There are errors throughout this code.
13: there is no clear invocation of functions
14: s should be defined as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime()
15: You're initializing assertEquals to believe the count will be one; while the actual count is three.  You need to change the 1 to a 3 on assertEquals.
