1: middle index is returned from this part of the code
2: At line 299; variable "s" is declared which contributes to setting "maxMiddleIndex"
3: s should be defined as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime()
4: 3
5: Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex. Since the assertion fails when checking the MaxMiddleIndex it is likely there is something wrong with the assessor functions or how the value they return is being manipulated.
