1: There is a problem with the argument  public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.
2: You are calling the Color constructor with three float parameters so the values are allowed to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
3: I'm not sure if this is the issue but the fact that int g is being defined by (int) could be causing some kind of parameter error.
