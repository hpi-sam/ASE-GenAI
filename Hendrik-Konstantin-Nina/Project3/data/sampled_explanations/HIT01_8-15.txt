1: It's because of second line negative value.
2: this cause assumes all negative minutes are bad. from the comment; negative minutes are ok when the hours are negative too. the comments specifically say its bad when the mins are negative but the hours are positive. there is a line break in the middle of that part of the comment which could lead a programmer to miss half of the info.
3: I believe the error is in the offset described in hours in line 284
4: You are passing it a negative offset value (-15) and the conditionals are set to reject any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59 and throw a new exception.
5: The argument -15 is less than 0; which causes the if statement conditional on line 279 to pass. This results in the exception on line 280 being thrown. According to the comment block above the method; minutesOffset should be checked for below -59 or above 59.
6: As noted in the comments; valid input for minutes must be in the rage -59 to +59 but on line 279 of the source minutesOffset is checked for < 0. Instead it should be minutesOFfset < -59 . Also noted in comments is that versions before 2.3 minutes had to be zero or positive. "Minutes out of range: + minutesOffset" is our error.
7: There may be an issue as it involves not indigenous java
8: the code is incomplete. it properly checks for greater than 59 but neglects to take into account if the hours are negative before rejecting minutes for being negative. it would be more correct though not completely to check for less than -59 instead of less than 0
9: the variable should be defined as "unsigned int" if we expect it to be always positive
10: Minutes are set to -15; which is less then 0 and it throws illegal arg exception
11: This variable contains a value of -15 as set by DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15). Line 279 checks to see if is a valid value; meaning that is between 0 and 59. Since it is not; an exception error is thrown in line 280.
12: Value passed in minutes -15;where as it checks (<0 | >53).
13: yep; they are checking if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception; and as -15 <0; it gets thrown. looks like they updated the comments but not the code. and this is why comments are evil liars that can't be trusted!
14: Yes there could be an issue with the parameters passed it will finally give answer millis out of range
15: The variable "minutesOffset" is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279. Any negative value for "minutesOffset" will throw this exception; while the documentation states that "minutesOffset" can be negative in some cases.
