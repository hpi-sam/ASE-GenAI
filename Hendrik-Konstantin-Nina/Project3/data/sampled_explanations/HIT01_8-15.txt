1: yep; they are checking if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception; and as -15 <0; it gets thrown. looks like they updated the comments but not the code. and this is why comments are evil liars that can't be trusted!
2: Yes; the variable gets set to -15 through the arguments above. The code specifically encounters the error on line 279 when it tests if minutesOffset < 0; (-15) which is the case; so it throws the error on line 280 : Minutes out of range: with the value provided for that argument -15.
3: There may be an issue as it involves not indigenous java
4: I believe the error is in the offset described in hours in line 284
5: As I seem to have misunderstood the previous question; for the sake of consistency; I will declare Yes; there is an issue BUT No; it is not with the variable "offset". The issue can be attributed to line 279 because the variable "minutesOffSet" is still parameterized to throw an exception if it is < 0; rather it should be: < -59 to correct this issue.
6: This is the argument exception thrown.
7: the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero
8: the variable should be defined as "unsigned int" if we expect it to be always positive
9: The argument -15 is less than 0; which causes the if statement conditional on line 279 to pass. This results in the exception on line 280 being thrown. According to the comment block above the method; minutesOffset should be checked for below -59 or above 59.
10: This conditional will reject any negative minute input; even if the hour input is also negative.
11: There is a logical check for if minuteOffset is less than 0 or greater than 59 causing it to throw an exception because the value is out of bounds (negative number)
12: According to the comments; the minute value should be between -59 and +59; but the conditional statement is checking for a value between 0 and 59.
13: Minutes are set to -15; which is less then 0 and it throws illegal arg exception
14: You are passing it a negative offset value (-15) and the conditionals are set to reject any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59 and throw a new exception.
15: In the code there is a check that 0 <= minutes < 60 and the minutesOffset is -15 which does not fall into these prarmeters thus throwing an Exception
