1: The array is not classified correctly
2: []array should be [array]
3: The second element of the array is null (which has no class); and the getClass method with produce a NullPointerException in this case.
4: I believe index 1 in the array being looped through is a null; so this would cause an exception since getClass expects an object; not null.
5: the getClass() method cannot read from null!
6: The for loop itself looks fine. However; the code contained within the for loop on line 910 may be causing the problem; because it may not handle the case where array[i] is null.
7: The array is being declared and pointing to an object; but the object is defined as null.
8: I think when it gets to array[i] when I is 1. It references null   So calling getClass() on null will give null pointer exception
9: As we iterate through Object's dimensions; there are null arrays in the middle. getClass doesn't work on nulls and throws a NullPointerException. You might try testing for these nulls at line 910 like so:    classes[i] = array[i] == null ? null : array[i].getClass();
10: getClass() method not defined
11: The issue is actually with the use of one of the members of the array variable. On line 910; there is no check for whether array[i] is null before array[i] is dereferenced; the second member of the test input array is null; causing the exception to be thrown.
12: There should be some code that says that if array[i] == null; to not attempt to getClass() and just class[i] = null;
13: i++ should be i+
14: Yes; I think that the NullPointerException is thrown when .getClass is called on the null listing in the middle of the arrays.
15: I'm not sure if the .getClass() call is actually calling anything that is defined in the programming. This could potentially be causing a null exception.
