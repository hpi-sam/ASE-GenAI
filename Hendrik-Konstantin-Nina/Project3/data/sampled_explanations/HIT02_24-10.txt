1: The color is out of the parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0
2: The variable "value" is incorrectly used on line 117; where the variable "v" should be used in its place. The variable "value" can exist beyond the range of "this.lowerBound" and "this.upperBound" and is causing this error.
3: there is an issue with colors in that programme
4: I'm not sure if this is the issue but the fact that int g is being defined by (int) could be causing some kind of parameter error.
5: depending on the upperBound and lowerBound values; "g" might exceed -255 or 255 which is not a valid value for the Color object.
6: should be a float number
7: i believe that some error there in that line
8: The argument value is checked against the lowerBound and upperBound variables; but the resulting variable v is never used in the code. Therefore; the value being -0.5 in this case results in a negative integer value; which is outside the expected 0 to 255 range for a color.
9: The exception is coming from Color; so it must be g that has a bad value.  I need to see the definition of this.lowerBound and this.upperBound to know what is wrong though.
10: yes ... should be computed using v; not value.
