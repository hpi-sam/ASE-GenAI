1: This variable contains a value of -15 as set by DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15). Line 279 checks to see if is a valid value; meaning that is between 0 and 59. Since it is not; an exception error is thrown in line 280.
2: the offset variable is still zero; making it out of range
3: According to the comments; the minute value should be between -59 and +59; but the conditional statement is checking for a value between 0 and 59.
