1: Type of the variable "type" may be incompatible
2: type will be object when it should be string
3: Yes; this is related to the failure (though not where the failure actually occurs). The logic here first checks the array type if it's not null; but because the array is null in our case; it sets "type" to a basic Object type. This value gets passed to copyArrayGrowl() which returns a copy of the array.     The "type" that's set in this line would usually be a backup value in case the array is null; but since the array is both null and the "type" value passed is a basic Object type; the array that's returned is an Object[] array; causing the failure later on.
4: Yes; as with the previous problems "type" gets set to the Object class when both "array" and "element" are null.
5: You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null.  It works fine as long as one of the parameters are not null.
6: The code is passing the class type as null.
7: The inferred type for the array is Object. However; sa which will be bound to the return value has a type of String[]. As the error message states Java can not cast an Object array to a String array.
8: I THINK THIS ANSWERS
9: That was my first impression; that the use of generics enforces type; and the copyArrayGrow1 method should return an object of type array; or the code will break. However; I could be wrong.
10: I think that the array and string being null is likely to cause a problem in this case.
11: The type variable being used at line 3290 is set up at line 3288. There we see if array and element both are null; then it is set to Object.class. Object classes are not implicitly converted to Strings because this can fail if the Object does not convert directly to a String (it could; but maybe not - thus the fail).    So; you are expecting an IllegalArgumentException from add; but there is no coding of this. You might try throwing an error instead of using Object.class by default. Something on the lines of:    Class<?> type;  if (array != null) {    type = array.getClass().getComponentType(); // if it isn't an array class; fail  } else if (element != null) {    type = element.getClass(); // build the collection on this type otherwise  } else {    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Arguments must not both be null!");  }
12: well the generic is recognized to be a String type by the jvm but then the type value is Object
13: element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class  -- the object is null so this is returning an Object type.
14: type will end up being a class object after this example. Other than that; I'm lost.
15: <?> is not defined.
16: It doesn't have any logic to make sure BOTH cases don't fail (and thus one can be null.)
17: If array is null and element is null it sets type to object class.
18: the template ends up with the class being type of string and the result is string[]
19: We are passing Null values
20: As mentioned before; we need to first verify that array parm is not null before using getClass on it so that there will be an instance that allows getClass to work. If it were me; I would write a simple if statement that's easy to understand.  The use of the : ? type statement is concise I guess; but when you start nesting them like this you're just begging for trouble; or just showing off in my not so humble opinion.
21: new array and copyArrayGrowl are different types; cannot equal each other
22: The type should be directly inferred from the Template argument types. The array should be made of the type specified; not the getClass() of either the array or the element.
23: I think this could be answered "Yes" or "No" legitimately.  The locus of the problem seems; to me; to be the choice of using a generic here; and particularly how it was typed in line 3288.  So; in that sense one might say that "No" there is not a problem.    However; this line we are examining in this equation; line 3290; does contain the definition of the variable "newArray" which is then able to be assigned the "offending" Object type.  So in that sense; there IS something wrong here with the use or definition of the variable.
24: ArrayUtils.add() method accepts Object parameters only and not String. So using T type converts your runtime objects to String and not as Objects.  So modify the class to use Objects instead of T type for this operation alone. Use a cast check if required; but stick to Objects for this. Alternatively; you can write your own add() method if you want it to accept String readily.
25: Same concept here you are trying to cast an object to an array and you are not allowed to do so.
