1: I think that the array and string being null is likely to cause a problem in this case.
2: Since the inputs are null; then return is an array of [null]. This cannot be cast to a type String.
3: The code is passing the class type as null.
4: i think new array value going to be null in this program ; it may be a cause of error
5: I think this could be answered "Yes" or "No" legitimately.  The locus of the problem seems; to me; to be the choice of using a generic here; and particularly how it was typed in line 3288.  So; in that sense one might say that "No" there is not a problem.    However; this line we are examining in this equation; line 3290; does contain the definition of the variable "newArray" which is then able to be assigned the "offending" Object type.  So in that sense; there IS something wrong here with the use or definition of the variable.
6: The type variable being used at line 3290 is set up at line 3288. There we see if array and element both are null; then it is set to Object.class. Object classes are not implicitly converted to Strings because this can fail if the Object does not convert directly to a String (it could; but maybe not - thus the fail).    So; you are expecting an IllegalArgumentException from add; but there is no coding of this. You might try throwing an error instead of using Object.class by default. Something on the lines of:    Class<?> type;  if (array != null) {    type = array.getClass().getComponentType(); // if it isn't an array class; fail  } else if (element != null) {    type = element.getClass(); // build the collection on this type otherwise  } else {    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Arguments must not both be null!");  }
7: Yes; as with the previous problems "type" gets set to the Object class when both "array" and "element" are null.
8: I THINK THIS ANSWERS
9: As mentioned before; we need to first verify that array parm is not null before using getClass on it so that there will be an instance that allows getClass to work. If it were me; I would write a simple if statement that's easy to understand.  The use of the : ? type statement is concise I guess; but when you start nesting them like this you're just begging for trouble; or just showing off in my not so humble opinion.
10: type will be object when it should be string
11: ArrayUtils.add() method accepts Object parameters only and not String. So using T type converts your runtime objects to String and not as Objects.  So modify the class to use Objects instead of T type for this operation alone. Use a cast check if required; but stick to Objects for this. Alternatively; you can write your own add() method if you want it to accept String readily.
12: It doesn't have any logic to make sure BOTH cases don't fail (and thus one can be null.)
13: If array is null and element is null it sets type to object class.
14: The declaration of newArray fails when it is null as in the example.
15: You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null.  It works fine as long as one of the parameters are not null.
16: Yes; type gets set to Object when both parameters to add are null which is what causes the ClassCastException.
17: The inferred type for the array is Object. However; sa which will be bound to the return value has a type of String[]. As the error message states Java can not cast an Object array to a String array.
18: We are passing Null values
19: Type of the variable "type" may be incompatible
20: element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class  -- the object is null so this is returning an Object type.
21: type will end up being a class object after this example. Other than that; I'm lost.
22: I believe the error is likely to be somewhere in this line given that the failure is a class cast exception and this is the line where the classes are being retrieved. I'm not confident in which part specifically the issue is though.
23: the template ends up with the class being type of string and the result is string[]
24: <?> is not defined.
25: new array and copyArrayGrowl are different types; cannot equal each other
