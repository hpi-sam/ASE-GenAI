1: there is no clear invocation of functions
2: Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex. Since the assertion fails when checking the MaxMiddleIndex it is likely there is something wrong with the assessor functions or how the value they return is being manipulated.
3: i think; instead of 3.0; we need to put 1.0
