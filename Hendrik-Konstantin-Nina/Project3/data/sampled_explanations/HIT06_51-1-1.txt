1: Yes. The problem is exactly that when we get to line 260 in our code (add(Long.toString(value));); we actually send 0 as an argument to the "add" method; not -0.0; because variable "value" is defined of type long eliminating our .0 portion of the number and automatically converting the remaining -0 to 0; since it's the same thing to the compiler. As a result; 0 is appended to our string; not -0.0.
