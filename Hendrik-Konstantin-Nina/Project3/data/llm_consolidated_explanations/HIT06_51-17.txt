The issue arises from a type mismatch when handling numeric values in a method call, resulting in incorrect output formatting. Specifically, when a negative decimal value like -0.0 is processed, the variable value is defined as a long. This conversion truncates the decimal portion (.0), leaving only 0. Consequently, the string representation appends 0 instead of the expected -0.0.

Additional observations indicate:

The incorrect value 0 is passed to the add method at line 260.
The method addNumber is affected due to an infinite loop scenario caused by conditions within a while loop, preventing further code execution and method calls.
There may also be issues with null handling and string comparisons in related code sections.
This bug affects both number formatting and the logical flow of method execution, possibly impacting test cases expecting specific outputs.
