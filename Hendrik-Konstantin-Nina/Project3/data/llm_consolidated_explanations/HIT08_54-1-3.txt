The bug in the code is that an else statement is missing, likely resulting in incorrect handling of conditions that do not meet any specified criteria. This may cause unanticipated behavior when the program encounters a situation where an alternative outcome should be defined but isn't. This needs to be investigated and corrected by adding the necessary else statement.
