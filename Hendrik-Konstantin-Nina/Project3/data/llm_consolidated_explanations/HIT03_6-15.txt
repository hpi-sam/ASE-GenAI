The code contains a potential issue with out-of-range access in string manipulation that can lead to a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Specifically:

The pos variable, which tracks the current position in a string, can be incremented beyond the string's length (input.length()). No boundary checks are present to prevent this.
If codePointAt() is used and returns a Unicode character value above 0x10000, the charCount() function may return 2. This result gets added to pos, potentially causing it to exceed the string length, resulting in an invalid index.
A related concern is found on line 95, where surrogate pairs might not be handled correctly in UTF-16 encoding. This may further contribute to incorrect position calculations in cases involving multi-byte characters.
On line 85, a recursive function call is made with an incorrect number of arguments, which might also be part of the broader issue in handling string or character data.
These issues cause the code to fail when string operations access invalid positions, especially when special characters or multi-byte Unicode characters are encountered.
