The issue arises from the invocation of the Color constructor, which is called with three float parameters. This constructor expects the values to fall within the range of 0.0 to 1.0. However, a potential bug is flagged due to the use of an (int) cast for one of these float parameters (g). This typecasting may be inadvertently truncating or altering the intended float value, resulting in an illegal or inappropriate argument, which throws an IllegalArgumentException.
