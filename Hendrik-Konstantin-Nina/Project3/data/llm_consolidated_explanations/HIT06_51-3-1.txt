Endless Loop in addNumber Method:
The while loop in the code never exits due to a logic error. This prevents the addNumber method from reaching its end, and as a result, the method remains stuck without returning or calling other required functions.

Incorrect Data Type Handling:
A value, expected to have decimal precision, is being processed incorrectly. The issue arises because the variable x is treated as a long, which inherently has no decimal places. This may result from either incorrect type assignment (not float or double) or premature rounding (floor or ceiling) before the final processing step.

Both bugs should be addressed to ensure correct program flow and data handling.
