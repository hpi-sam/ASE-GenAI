The issue is a potential StringIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by improper handling of the pos variable within a loop. The following observations indicate the root cause:

Position Counter Increment: The pos variable is being incremented at both line 89 and line 95 inside a while loop. This can lead to pos exceeding the length of the input string (len).

Condition Misalignment: The loop continues executing while the condition pt < consumed is true, but this condition does not directly ensure that pos stays within valid string bounds.

Input Dependency: On line 95, pos is incremented by a value related to the input, which, if not properly constrained, could cause the program to step beyond the valid range of the string, resulting in the exception.

This bug risks causing the program to crash if the input or loop conditions are not adequately controlled to prevent pos from exceeding string length.
