In the code section from lines 299 to 302, there is an incorrect reference to the variable this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex on line 301. This leads to a miscalculation when setting up the values for s and e, which affects the computation of maxMiddleIndex. The getDataItem method invocation in line 301 fetches data from the wrong index, resulting in incorrect period boundaries for calculations.

Details:

At line 299, s is correctly defined using this.maxMiddleIndex.
At line 301, e incorrectly references this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex.
The function getDataItem() is likely fetching invalid data due to this index mismatch, potentially causing assertion or boundary errors in subsequent logic.
This inconsistency likely contributes to failures in boundary condition checks and related calculations in the surrounding logic.
