Type mismatch: The type is being assigned as object when it should be string.
Variable initialization issue: The declaration of newArray fails when it is initialized with a null value.
Incorrect return behavior: If the inputs are null, the function returns an array containing [null]. This result cannot be cast to a String type, leading to further errors.
Ensure that the data types and initialization logic handle null cases correctly to prevent type conversion issues.
