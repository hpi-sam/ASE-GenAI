The minutesOffset variable is being checked incorrectly in the conditional statement on line 279. The code currently throws an exception whenever minutesOffset has a negative value, which conflicts with the documented behavior stating that negative minutesOffset values are valid under specific conditions.
The issue arises from an assumption that all negative minutes are invalid. However, based on the comment in the code, negative minutes are acceptable when accompanied by a negative hoursOffset. The bug is compounded by a poorly formatted comment with a line break that obscures the critical context about when negative minutes are problematic (only when hours are positive).
This inconsistency between the code and documentation, as well as the misleading comment, needs to be addressed.
