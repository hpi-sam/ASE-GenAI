When both the array and element parameters are null in the method being discussed, the type variable is set to Object.class by default. This leads to a cascading failure when copyArrayGrowl() attempts to handle the array since it returns an Object[], causing a ClassCastException during subsequent operations.

Key points:

The method does not verify if both parameters (array and element) are null.
In the absence of a valid type from either parameter, Object.class is used, which fails later when casting is attempted.
The failure occurs due to improper type handling and absence of an early exception (IllegalArgumentException) to prevent null type propagation.
