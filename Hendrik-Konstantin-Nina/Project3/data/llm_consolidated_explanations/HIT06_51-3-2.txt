The add method may be causing the issue. The bug potentially lies within the maybeEndStatement method, which might not be handling the exp variable correctly. This variable either fails to receive a usable value or is rendered unusable, preventing code execution under certain conditions. Additionally, there is a problematic while loop that could be contributing to the error. This loop might require correction for proper execution flow.
