The variable type is assigned incorrectly under specific conditions, leading to an error later in the code execution.

Context: The type variable is set when both the array and element parameters are null. In this case, type is assigned Object.class.

Issue: When this type is passed to copyArrayGrowl(), it infers the array type as Object[]. However, the return value of this method is expected to be of type String[]. Since Java cannot cast an Object[] to String[], a ClassCastException or similar failure occurs.

Impact: This mismatch causes runtime type errors, preventing the array handling logic from functioning correctly.

Contributing Factor: The code lacks proper handling or validation for scenarios where both array and element are null, resulting in a fallback to the generic Object.class type instead of throwing an appropriate exception.

Observations:
The method where the bug occurs assumes that type should always be safely convertible to the expected array type, which is violated when Object.class is used.
A suggestion was noted in the comments that an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown if both parameters are null to prevent this issue.
