At line 299, the variable s is incorrectly declared or defined, impacting the calculation of maxMiddleIndex. The expected definition of s should be:
long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime();
Currently, the incorrect handling of s affects the subsequent logic where assessor functions are called at line 301 to set variables related to maxMiddleIndex. This results in a failure during assertions that check the value of maxMiddleIndex. The issue may either stem from how the assessor functions are returning values or from incorrect manipulation of these values within the calculation logic.
