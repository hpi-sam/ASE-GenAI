The method ClassUtils.toClass() is throwing a NullPointerException. This happens because the input array, such as new Object[]{"Test", null, 99d}, contains a null element at position 1. The loop in the method does not handle null elements properly. When it encounters array[i] == null, it tries to call the getClass() method on the null element, which results in the exception. The logic in the loop does not check if the current array element is null before attempting this operation.
