The bug occurs in the section of code responsible for updating various index variables, including maxMiddleIndex. Specifically, on line 301, the getDataItem method incorrectly uses this.minMiddleIndex as its argument instead of this.maxMiddleIndex. This leads to incorrect data retrieval for time bounds, resulting in incorrect updates to the maxMiddleIndex.

Relevant Details:
The method invocation for getDataItem on line 301 should target this.maxMiddleIndex.
The incorrect assignment causes improper calculation of the maxMiddleIndex, leading to potential assertion failures and logical errors in middle index calculations.
The variable e is assigned the result of getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime(), which should instead reference this.maxMiddleIndex.
This bug impacts the integrity of index-based operations and boundary conditions for middle index calculations within the affected code block.
