A NullPointerException is triggered during the iteration of an array on line 910 due to a null element. Specifically, the second element (index 1) of the array is null, and the getClass() method is called without a null check. Since getClass() cannot operate on a null reference, this leads to the exception. There is no handling mechanism in place to prevent this null reference from being dereferenced.
