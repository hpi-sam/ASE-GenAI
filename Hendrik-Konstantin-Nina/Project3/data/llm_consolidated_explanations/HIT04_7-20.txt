The issue occurs on line 301 of the code, where getDataItem() is called with an incorrect parameter. The function receives this.minMiddleIndex instead of the correct this.maxMiddleIndex. This leads to erroneous updates when calculating and verifying bounds for maxMiddleIndex.

Key Points:
The function getDataItem() should be passed this.maxMiddleIndex but is mistakenly passed this.minMiddleIndex.
This affects the value retrieved by the getTime() method and disrupts bounds calculations for indices such as maxMiddleIndex.
The error is mirrored in other nearby lines (e.g., line 299), causing multiple incorrect method invocations.
This issue results in assertion failures when validating the maxMiddleIndex.
Impact:
Incorrect bounds updates.
Potential assertion failures during verification processes.
Mismatch in expected versus actual data points for index variables related to maxMiddleIndex.
