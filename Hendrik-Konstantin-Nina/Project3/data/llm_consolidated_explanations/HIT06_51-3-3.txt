The issue arises from a clause that references the character "E." It is leading to an incorrect or failing behavior in the code execution.
There is ambiguity regarding the functionality of the add() method. It is suspected to only build strings, but its exact role is unclear.
A portion of the code, possibly the one handling expressions, might require a condition like if (exp > 0) to handle the logic properly. This likely relates to how expressions are evaluated, which may be impacting the output's correctness.
Additionally, a part of the code that defines valid characters in expressions could also be contributing to the problem.
This information suggests that the error involves string construction and expression evaluation, with "E" being a critical factor in the failure.
