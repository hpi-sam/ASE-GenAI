A StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error occurs in a code section where string manipulation is handled. The issue is centered around the pos variable being incremented to a value that exceeds the length of the input string, particularly around line 95.

Line References:

Line 89: pos is incremented by a value based on the input's character properties.
Line 95: The Character.codePointAt method attempts to read from the input string at the pos index, which may be out of bounds.
Condition Details:

The while loop controlling these increments appears to lack a sufficient boundary check for pos against the input length.
The for loop iterating with pt < consumed does not correlate with ensuring pos remains within valid string index boundaries.
If the character at pos is a surrogate pair, Character.charCount can add 2 to pos, which can push it beyond the string length.
Potential Edge Cases:

Surrogate pair handling (characters with Unicode values greater than 0x10000).
Incrementing pos multiple times without ensuring the input string's length constraint.
If consumed or input handling within recursive calls is not properly controlled, pos may become invalid in subsequent iterations.
This bug needs a review of index boundary checks and loop control logic to prevent exceeding the input string length when pos is incremented.
