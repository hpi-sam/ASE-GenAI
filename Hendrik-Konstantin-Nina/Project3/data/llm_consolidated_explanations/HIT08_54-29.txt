The bug occurs in lines 115-116 when validating a locale string format. The validation expects a specific structure where the third and fourth characters of the string represent an uppercase country code. However, in the test case fr__POSIX, the third character (assigned to ch3) is an underscore (_), which falls outside the valid range of characters (A to Z). Consequently, the conditional check on line 115 fails because _ is greater than Z in ASCII, triggering an IllegalArgumentException.

Additionally, a second failure may arise on line 121 if the string length exceeds five characters. In this case, the sixth character is expected to be an underscore but is not, leading to another exception.

The core issues are:

The validation does not handle cases where there are consecutive underscores (e.g., no country code is provided).
The error message may not clearly describe which part of the string format caused the failure.
