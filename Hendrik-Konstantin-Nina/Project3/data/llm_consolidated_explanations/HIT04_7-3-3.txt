The issue is related to the calculation of MaxMiddleIndex.

There is no clear invocation of functions, which may be causing disorganized execution flow or improper value assignments.
Line 301 calls assessor functions to set variables used in calculating MaxMiddleIndex. An assertion fails when validating MaxMiddleIndex, suggesting that the assessor functions or their returned values are incorrect or mismanaged.
There is a suspicion that a value of 3.0 is being used where 1.0 may be more appropriate, possibly affecting critical calculations.
These points suggest either an incorrect function setup, variable manipulation, or parameter value that leads to the assertion failure.
