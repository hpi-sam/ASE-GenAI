The bug involves the incorrect usage of minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex when calculating time values in a section of the code that updates index bounds. Specifically:

On line 299, the method getDataItem uses this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex when retrieving the period's start time.
Similarly, on line 301, this.minMiddleIndex is incorrectly used to retrieve the period's end time.
This causes the time values (s and e) used in calculating maxMiddleIndex to be incorrect, leading to assertion failures and improper bounds updates for index variables.
