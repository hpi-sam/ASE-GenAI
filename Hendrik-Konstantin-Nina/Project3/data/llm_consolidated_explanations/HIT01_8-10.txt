The bug arises from a logical error in the validation of the minutesOffset variable. The current implementation checks if the minutesOffset value is between 0 and 59 on line 279. If the value is outside this range, an exception is thrown on line 280. However, the documentation specifies that negative values for minutesOffset are valid in certain cases, such as when used with a negative hoursOffset.

Currently, when the minutesOffset is set to -15 (e.g., through DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2, -15)), the condition fails the range check and throws an exception, although this should be acceptable behavior based on the documentation. This discrepancy between the code logic and the documentation is the cause of the bug. Additionally, misleading comments with a line break may lead developers to misinterpret when negative values are permissible, contributing to confusion.
