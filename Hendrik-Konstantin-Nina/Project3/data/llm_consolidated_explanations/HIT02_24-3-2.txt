Unsanitized Input: The method handling the range does not validate that the lower range value is positive. This allows for negative input values to pass through unsanitized.

g Value Calculation: The function calculating g can result in a negative integer if the input parameter is negative. Since g is passed into a color parameter, it generates an error, particularly when there is no safeguard to prevent negative values in the calculation.

Color Parameter Constraint: The output color parameter must stay within the range [0.0, 1.0]. The absence of proper constraints or checks leads to color values that fall outside this acceptable range.

This bug arises from improper input validation and lack of boundary checks in both the parameter handling and color output.
