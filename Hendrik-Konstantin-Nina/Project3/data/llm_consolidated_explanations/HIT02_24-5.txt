The code involves color parameter handling where values are expected to be within the range of 0 to 255.
The argument for a color value is verified using lowerBound and upperBound variables. However, the resulting value (v) after the check is not utilized further in the code.
A specific case results in the variable being assigned a value of -0.5, causing an invalid color parameter outside of the expected range.
The exception message indicates the issue originates from the Color constructor, specifically related to the value of the g color component.
There are additional inconsistencies with parameter expectations, as another check implies the range should be between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of 0 to 255.
This bug revolves around improper value handling and parameter range mismatches in color processing logic.
