The issue likely arises from the way the integer variable g is being defined. Specifically, g is declared using (int) type casting, which could potentially cause parameter-related errors, possibly due to incorrect or conflicting type expectations within the function or code segment where it is used.

This should be verified in the code where g is defined and how it interacts with other parameters or operations.
