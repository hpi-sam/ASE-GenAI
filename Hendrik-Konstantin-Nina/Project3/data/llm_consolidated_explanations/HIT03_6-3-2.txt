The bug arises in a function where the Character.codePointAt method might throw an exception when certain conditions are met. The issue is triggered when the pos variable reaches the value of 2, which leads to an exception potentially at line 87.

Key points related to the bug:

The pos variable should not logically reach 2 and still allow further iterations of the loop. However, it seems to bypass validation at line 84, where pos is checked against the len variable for validity.
There is a recursive function call at line 85, where improper arguments are passed, leading to unintended behavior and possibly a faulty return value.
In some cases, based on the input, the pos variable can exceed the length of the input string, further contributing to this bug.
The exception is suspected to originate from line 95 under these conditions.
