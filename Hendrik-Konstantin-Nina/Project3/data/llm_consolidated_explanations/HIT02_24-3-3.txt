Variable Misuse on Line 117:
The variable value is incorrectly used on line 117. Instead, the variable v should be used. The use of value causes issues as it may extend beyond the limits defined by this.lowerBound and this.upperBound.

There is a related issue where calculations should use the variable v instead of value. This may cause incorrect results or behavior in computation due to the same variable misuse.
