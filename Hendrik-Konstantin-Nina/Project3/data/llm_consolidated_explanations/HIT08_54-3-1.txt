The input string fr__POSIX does not adhere to the expected format specified in the documentation. According to the javadoc, the fourth character should be part of the country code and must be an uppercase letter, but an underscore (_) is present instead. This causes the underscore at position 3 (referred to as ch3) to be assigned and pass a conditional check, leading to an exception being thrown at line 116. Additionally, ch3 does not meet the valid range criteria in line 115, contributing to this behavior.
