Issue: The code retrieves a time period using this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex. This misalignment leads to incorrect bounds updates and erroneous calculations of the maxMiddleIndex time span.
Details:
The period start (s) and period end (e) values are derived using the incorrect index (this.minMiddleIndex) when calculating maxMiddleIndex.
Specifically, the method call on line 301 should use getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex) instead of getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex).
This results in faulty assertions and incorrect conditional checks where the bounds of maxMiddleIndex are evaluated against inappropriate time period data.
This bug impacts the accuracy of index-based operations by introducing mismatched data during bound evaluations. Proper indexing alignment is critical for correct time span computation and assertion handling.
