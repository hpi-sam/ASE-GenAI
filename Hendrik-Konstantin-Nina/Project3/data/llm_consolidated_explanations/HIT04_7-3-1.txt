Incorrect comparison in data item retrieval (Line 299):
The function getDataItem uses this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex. This leads to a comparison between new maxMiddle and current minMiddle, instead of the intended comparison with maxMiddle. This also affects the following line (Line 300).

Incorrect initialization parameters:
During the initialization of e and s, the function getDataItem is called with this.minMiddleIndex as a parameter. This should instead be this.maxMiddleIndex.

Runtime error:
The system throws an error: Could not find or load main class undefined. This indicates a possible issue with classpath configuration or a missing main class declaration.
