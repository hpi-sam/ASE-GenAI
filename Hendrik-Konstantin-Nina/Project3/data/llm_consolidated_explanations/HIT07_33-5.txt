On line 910 of the code, there is a null pointer dereference. The second element of an input array (array[i] where i = 1) is null. However, the code does not perform a null check before attempting to call the getClass() method on this element. This results in a NullPointerException being raised during execution.

This issue arises due to incorrect handling of the input array and the template not anticipating null values.
