The bug arises from the handling of negative zero in numeric operations. Specifically, in the code at line 260, a call to add(Long.toString(value)) is made. Here, value is a long type, which lacks any decimal representation. When a negative zero -0.0 is processed, the conversion to a long results in 0, eliminating the negative sign. Consequently, the method appends 0 instead of -0.0 to the string. The expected output of -0. is thus not returned because the long type inherently strips away the decimal and the negative sign when representing zero.
