The code currently throws an exception when minutesOffset is less than 0. This behavior is causing issues, particularly for cases like minutesOffset = -15. It appears that while the comments in the code have been updated to indicate a different expected behavior, the actual logic that triggers the exception has not been updated accordingly, leading to a mismatch between the code's logic and the documented intent. This discrepancy creates confusion and errors during execution, making the comments misleading and untrustworthy.
