Functionality: The issue occurs during the calculation and updating of bounds for index variables (minStartIndex, maxStartIndex, minMiddleIndex, maxMiddleIndex, etc.).
Issue: Instead of using this.maxMiddleIndex as an argument in the getDataItem method, the code mistakenly uses this.minMiddleIndex. This causes incorrect data to be retrieved when determining the time span through the getTime method.
Impact: The use of incorrect index (minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex) leads to improper bounds updates, which further results in incorrect calculations related to maxMiddleIndex.
Symptoms: Failing assertions when verifying the maxMiddleIndex, suggesting errors in either the data retrieval logic or manipulation of the retrieved values.
This bug needs to be addressed by correctly using the intended index variable in the getDataItem method call.
