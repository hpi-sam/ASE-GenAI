We only update this.maxStartIndex if start is greater than maxStart; which comes from using the current this.maxStartIndex and getting the milliseconds from it. The thing is that if start == maxStart; we don't set the index. I'm assuming that if start == maxStart; that means we have two values in milliseconds that are equal in the series; therefore they would have different indexes. I'm thinking that if start == maxStart; we should set this.maxStartIndex to the greater of the current this.maxStartIndex; or index that is passed into the function.,0.15282910762673585,-0.4843960206867461,1.0142286111005188,3,2.8235688952590534,1.8798484896767567,1,22,578.0,78.04,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think using a different name would make the code more readable; and enable someone maintaining the code to have a better shot at understanding it and fixing it. Perhaps you have to define array to be of type Object instead of assuming it's actually an array of some type like String if you're going to let folks call it with a null array.  Then the cast won't fail; and you can go through further steps to find out IF its class is Array; an then if so you can get the class of the first array object to figure out it's a String.

The problem; instead; seems to be on line 95. We iterate from 0 to ""consumed"" and add the number of characters required for that particular code point to our ""pos"" variable. In our case ""consumed"" should be 2; and so we'll have 2 iterations. Our first iteration Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input; pos)) will return 2 since the code point for \uD83D is greater than 10;000 and we need 2 characters to express it. So our ""pos"" variable will become 2. The next iteration we'll invoke codePointAt again with the second argument (""pos"") equal to 2; which throws the exception because ""input"" variable has only indices up to 1. The discrepancy happens because in reality input.length() returns 2 as we only seem to have 2 characters; but charCount(codePointAt(input; 0)) returns 2 for just the first code point since its value is greater than 10;000 and actually needs 2 characters to be represented.",-0.45378488879938494,-0.4843960206867461,1.0142286111005188,4,-0.31035571208375484,-1.088198785728567,1,22,1019.0,62.98,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However; the logic at line 3288 that sets ""type"" (which copyArrayGrowl() uses) sets it to a basic Object type since both the array and the value are null. Typically; copyArrayGrowl() would match the array type; but since the array is null it uses the value that we pass from ""type"" to create it.

I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.    There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below.  Also; I feel like I'm missing additional code if the output above is returned.,-0.45378488879938494,-0.4843960206867461,1.0142286111005188,3,0.7744643443041404,0.4507886904075267,1,21,786.0,56.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I cannot propose a solution without seeing the source code of the method ""parsePrint"".",0.7594431040528566,0.6835869076981184,1.0142286111005188,3,-0.4308912739046321,-0.20877737079365632,1,21,481.0,67.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So it is completely unrelated to the failure. The source code provided doesn't quite match the code that is being tested; at least since we only get to look at the version of add() method with one parameter; while in the tested code we have s.add taking two arguments. So it's hard to predict what that 3.0 stands for. However; the obvious typo that is present in the source code provided; that might very well be the cause of the failure; is in lines 299 and 301. In this segment of the code we're dealing with maxMiddleIndex and should really be getting values for our calculations from this.maxMiddleIndex; not this.minMiddleIndex. Because of this typo what we're actually doing is checking whether the middle value of our currently processed time period is greater than the middle value of the time period with the lowest middle value; which is incoherent with our logic and is sure to cause invalid results.,2.2759780951181585,1.2675783718905507,1.0142286111005188,4,-0.31035571208375484,-1.088198785728567,1,22,1006.0,62.27,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If one of the strings needs .escapeCsv(); does the other? Does .escapeCsv() call translate? I am assuming it must.    A line number for the error would be helpful.    On line 85; translate is being passed 3 arguments when it only takes 2 parameters. I'm not sure how this is possible. Its return value is also being assigned to the int ""consumed"" yet it is a void function. Furthermore; the function seems to be recursively calling itself in a way that would not advance progression (still with incorrect arguments).    On first call of translate; for example; it would; itself; call translate with  (input; 0; out) which are invalid arguments and would just lead to translate calling itself again with the same arguments. I can see in the loop where pos WOULD increment but it recursively calls Translate first.    I am assuming I am just missing some of the ins and outs of Java; so anyway;  the only thing I can guess might be wrong with out is that translate it passing it as a third parameter to itself with no apparent override that actually takes 3 parameters.",-0.45378488879938494,-0.4843960206867461,-0.20568272532807705,1,-0.6719623975463865,-0.31870504766052016,1,20,1525.0,71.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's three completely different things:    public means that the method is visible and can be called from other objects of other types. Other alternatives are private; protected; package and package-private. See here for more details.    static means that the method is associated with the class; not a specific instance (object) of that class. This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.    void means that the method has no return value. If the method returned an int you would write int instead of void.    The combination of all three of these is most commonly seen on the main method which most tutorials will include.  ,0.15282910762673585,-0.4843960206867461,-0.20568272532807705,3,-0.31035571208375484,0.011077982940071375,0,6,719.0,74.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyway; the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable.    If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero.,3.4892060879704,3.0195527644678473,1.0142286111005188,1,0.5333932206623858,0.8904993978749821,1,23,856.0,69.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now the method; public static boolean equals(Object[] a;Object[] a2) Returns true if the two specified arrays of Objects are equal to one another. The two arrays are considered equal if both arrays contain the same number of elements; and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two arrays are equal. Two objects e1 and e2 are considered equal if (e1==null ? e2==null : e1.equals(e2)). In other words; the two arrays are equal if they contain the same elements in the same order. Also; two array references are considered equal if both are null.  and we have null inserted into the arrays to be compared ==> java.lang.NullPointerException,-0.45378488879938494,-0.4843960206867461,-0.20568272532807705,3,1.3771421534085264,1.550065459076165,1,20,893.0,65.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some more numbers from what happens when this runs would really help.    The only thing that strikes me as odd is that maxMiddle is being calculated in basically the same way as minMiddle; excluding the one condition.

As I indicated before; the problem; instead; seems to be on line 95. We iterate from 0 to ""consumed"" and add the number of characters required for that particular code point to our ""pos"" variable. In our case ""consumed"" should be 2; and so we'll have 2 iterations. Our first iteration Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input; pos)) will return 2 since the code point for \uD83D is greater than 10;000 and we need 2 characters to express it. So our ""pos"" variable will become 2. The next iteration we'll invoke codePointAt again with the second argument (""pos"") equal to 2; which throws the exception because ""input"" variable has only indices up to 1.

The one you show takes a TimePeriodValue. (wrong number of arguments). Assuming that SimpleTimePeriod is a subclass of TimePeriodValue; the first arg would be an ok type.  According to the web; these classes are from org.jfree.data.time on jfreechart.  The top line of SimpleTimePeriod is public class SimpleTimePeriod implements TimePeriod; Comparable; Serializable. The top line of TimePeriodValue is public class TimePeriodValue implements Cloneable; Serializable so STP is not a subclass of TPV and you are showing us the wrong add method.     The period of the TPV is sent to updatebounds and you likely needed to show us the TPV constructor so we knew which input the period was (0L or 50L).   public TimePeriodValue(TimePeriod period; Number value) {          if (period == null) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Null 'period' argument."");          }          this.period = period;          this.value = value;      }  What we actually have is two longs from STP  public SimpleTimePeriod(long start; long end) {          if (start > end) {              throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Requires start <= end."");          }          this.start = start;          this.end = end;      }  btw; here is the documentation link on the web. Since you are studying tool usage.. thats the tool i'm using. http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/index.html    Your add method seems to want to pass a whole time period (the whole STP) and the number of items-1 (aka 0) in the set of time periods... ok.. calling updatebounds on the whole STP and 0.    we'll also need getMaxMiddleIndex() which is not shown here.  The documentation says ""Returns the index of the time period with the maximum middle milliseconds."" there is only one time period in this set so its gotta be the index of this time period.    Unfortunatly I'm not finding code for TimePeriodValues; just TimePeriodValue and SimpleTimePeriod so I'm unsure what the min and max start indexes are. Really; if one of my students gave me this and asked for help; I'd make them show me the relevant code and have them handtrace thru it. Its rather annoying doing this without the actual code that it calls. I'm stopping.

I suspect java has representations for both -0.0 and 0.0 for floating point numbers but not integers. The code on line 260 may not even get execute because the block starting at line 247 may never be entered. After the explicit conversion to a long and then the implicit conversion back to a double for the comparison I think you may end up with the test 0.0 == -0.0 we I imagine would evaluate to false. If this is the case then line 263 gets executed and I suspect String.valueOf(x) is converting -0.0 to 0.    If the code block on line 247 is entered then I suspect the issue is line 248. I believe longs only have one representation for zero so the cast converts -0.0 to 0. There is a small chance that longs have a -0 value in which case the issue could be with line 260 but I don't think that is the case.,-0.45378488879938494,-0.4843960206867461,1.0142286111005188,1,0.5333932206623858,0.8904993978749821,1,23,891.0,84.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But maybe it is for the case '-4' being appended to 'x-' for some reason.  It isn't clear where the var 'code' is defined or what it's scope is but I'm assuming it is in an outer scope and represents source code being parsed and printed by the function parsePrint() in the assertEquals() above.  I assume that add() appends a string onto the same var that add() appends onto (though I don't see why one would need both) and this section is putting a space in between any preceding '-' in the input and any '-' to be appended that represents the first char of a negative number.  addNumber would better be called concatNumberStr() or similar I think.,0.7594431040528566,0.6835869076981184,-0.20568272532807705,3,1.9798199625129127,2.4294868740110758,1,20,761.0,68.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
