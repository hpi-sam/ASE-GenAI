The bug occurs when incrementing the pos variable beyond the input string's length while processing Unicode characters. In the loop (lines 84-97), pos is increased by consumed (1 or 2 for surrogate pairs) without checking if the new value exceeds the input's length. This results in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing input at an invalid index (e.g., pos=2 for a 2-character input). The error manifests specifically at line 95, where pos is updated, or during subsequent access (e.g., codePointAt(pos)), as the loop's condition fails to prevent pos from surpassing the valid range.
