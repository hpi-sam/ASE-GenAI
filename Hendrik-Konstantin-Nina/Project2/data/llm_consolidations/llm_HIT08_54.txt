At line 115, the condition if (ch3 > 'A' || ch3 < 'Z' || ch4 >'A' || ch4 < 'Z') is causing an issue when ch3 is an underscore ('_'), as it falls outside the expected range of 'A' to 'Z'. The check incorrectly flags _ as greater than 'Z', throwing an exception. Additionally, line 121-122 also fails because the 6th character in the string is not an underscore, which is expected by the format validation. The fix requires correcting the condition to properly handle underscores and ensuring the format follows the strict requirements.
