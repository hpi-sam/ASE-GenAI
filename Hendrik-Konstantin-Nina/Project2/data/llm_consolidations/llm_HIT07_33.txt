The array is not handled correctly in the for-loop. On line 910, the code attempts to dereference array[i] without checking if it is null. This results in a NullPointerException when array[i] is null, as calling .getClass() on a null object causes the exception. The fix involves adding a null check before calling getClass() to avoid the exception and set classes[i] to null if array[i] is null.
