# Task 3.1 Creation of an Execution Plan with the LLM based on the SQL Query from Task 2.1

## Conversation with ChatGPT
The conversation with ChatGPT was long and required multiple prompts to get the desired output.
Therefore, we will only show the final output here.
The full conversation can be found [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/673df978-8adc-8003-bae1-21a55ef2ac86).

## Final Output:
Given your database schema, I can refine the hypothetical execution plan for your query. Let's analyze how PostgreSQL would likely handle it step by step.

### Key Observations:
1. Relevant Tables:
   - knows: Captures relationships between people.
   - likes: Tracks message likes.
   - message: Contains post and comment data with metadata like creator and length.
   - person: Contains person details like name.

2. Indexes:
   - Primary keys aren't explicitly defined, but assuming the columns with NOT NULL (e.g., k_person1id, l_messageid, m_messageid) have implicit indexes.

3. Data Volume:
   - Tables like likes and knows might contain millions of rows in a social network context.

4. Complexity:
   - Four CTEs and multiple joins with filters and aggregations.

### 1. KnownRelationships CTE
1. KnownRelationships CTE
   - Operation: UNION of two queries to gather direct and indirect relationships.
   - Execution:
     - First SELECT: LEFT JOIN within the knows table.
     - Second SELECT: Fetch distinct pairs from knows.
     - Deduplication via HashAggregate (DISTINCT).
   - Indexes: Likely uses indexes on k_person1id and k_person2id.
- Plan:
```text
HashAggregate (DISTINCT operation)
-> Append
   -> Hash Join (k1.k_person2id = k2.k_person1id)
      -> Index Scan on knows k1
      -> Index Scan on knows k2
   -> Index Scan on knows
```

### 2. ForeignLikes CTE
- Operation: Identify likes from people who are neither friends nor friends-of-friends, and assign ROW_NUMBER().
- Execution:
  - Join message with likes.
  - Filter foreign likes using LEFT JOIN with KnownRelationships.
  - ROW_NUMBER() computation.
- Indexes:
  - message(m_messageid) and likes(l_messageid) are critical.
  - Likely uses a Hash Join for KnownRelationships.
- Plan:
```text
WindowAgg (ROW_NUMBER operation)
-> Hash Join
   -> Hash Join
      -> Sequential Scan on message
      -> Index Scan on likes (l_messageid)
   -> Hash Join (filtering with KnownRelationships)
      -> HashAggregate (KnownRelationships)
      -> Sequential Scan on knows
```


### 3. FirstForeignLiker CTE
- Operation: Filter to keep only the first foreign liker (rn = 1) and fetch their name.
- Execution:
  - Filter ForeignLikes on rn = 1.
  - Join with person to fetch the name.
- Indexes:
  - person(p_personid) for joining.
- Plan:
```text
Hash Join
-> Filter (rn = 1) on ForeignLikes
-> Index Scan on person (p_personid)
```

### 4. MessageStats CTE
- Operation: Compute total likes and foreign like counts for messages.
- Execution:
  - Join message with likes.
  - Aggregate likes by message_id with conditions (m_length > 100).
  - Filter foreign likes via KnownRelationships.
- Indexes:
  - message(m_messageid) and likes(l_messageid) for efficient join.
- Plan:
```text
HashAggregate (GROUP BY m_messageid)
-> Hash Join
   -> Sequential Scan on message (filtered by m_length > 100)
   -> Hash Join (with likes)
      -> Index Scan on likes (l_messageid)
      -> Hash Join (with KnownRelationships)
         -> HashAggregate (KnownRelationships)
         -> Sequential Scan on knows
```

### 5. Final Query
- Operation:
  - Join MessageStats with FirstForeignLiker.
  - Apply filters (total_likes >= 20 and foreign_like_count >= ms.total_likes / 2). 
  - Sort by the ratio of foreign_like_count / total_likes.
- Execution:
  - Perform a Hash Join to combine results.
  - Sort the results using ORDER BY.
- Plan:
```text
Sort (ORDER BY ratio foreign_like_count / total_likes DESC)
-> Hash Join
   -> Filter (total_likes >= 20 and foreign_like_count >= total_likes / 2)
      -> HashAggregate (MessageStats)
      -> HashAggregate (FirstForeignLiker)
```

### Optimizations to Consider
1. Indexes:
    - Composite indexes:
      - knows(k_person1id, k_person2id)
      - likes(l_messageid, l_personid)
      - message(m_messageid, m_creatorid, m_length)
    - Single-column indexes:
      - person(p_personid)

2. Reduce Intermediate Results:
   - Apply filters (m_length > 100, total_likes >= 20) earlier in the pipeline to reduce data volume.
3. Analyze Join Cardinality:
   - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to verify if joins generate unexpectedly large intermediate results.
