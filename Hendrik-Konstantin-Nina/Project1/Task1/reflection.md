# Reflection Task 1

## Prior Knowledge
Before starting the tasks we had the following knowledge:
- 2 team members only with basic SQL knowledge who did not use this knowledge for multiple years
- 1 team member intermediate SQL knowledge. While many of the concepts were known the member had no experience with complex queries

## Task 1.1

### Steps
To simlify the task we decided to split the task into two parts.
We first created the query without the foreign like count as we identified this as the most difficult part.
After we had the query without the foreign like count we added the foreign like count.

### Time & Difficulty
Overall we consider the task as difficult, especially the part with the foreign like count.
It took us especially long to get the idea with the SQL Case expression to get the foreign like count.
This was the most difficult part.
We also made a lot of mistakes until we got the correct join for the foreign like count.
Lastly we forgot to cast the sum the foreign like count to float to get the correct ratio.
Overall the task took about 2,5 hours.

## Task 1.2

For this task, we chose to use Copilot Chat due to the seamless integration with the IDE and the availability of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. This allowed us to directly reference files from the project, enabling a more interactive and iterative query development process. We chose to use the Claude model, as from personal experience, it yields better and faster results compared to other models, when it comes to coding tasks.

### Steps

1. Open the `create_tables.sql` file (the specification tables in the database)
2. Copy the query description from the PDF
3. Set the reference file and the query description into context
4. Review the LLM response

### Time & Difficulty

Unlike the previous task (1.1), this one was straightforward and easy to complete. The LLM provided a precise description of the intent and the resulting query was correct and did not need any further changes. The code was clean and easy to understand, and the explanation of the query was concise. The time to get the correct query was approximately 2 minutes, and the time to understand and review the LLM response was around 10 minutes.

### Interaction with the LLM

The quality of the LLM response was very good. Firstly, the LLM provided a description of intent, which helped us understand the different parts of the query. The code generated was very clear, making it easy to link the different parts of the query to the task description. We only had to prompt the LLM once to get the correct query, and there were no misunderstandings. Compared to the previous task, we needed much less knowledge of different concepts and possibilities in SQL to get the correct query.
