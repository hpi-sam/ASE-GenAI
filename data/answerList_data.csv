The source code provided doesn't quite match the code that is being tested; at least since we only get to look at the version of add() method with one parameter; while in the tested code we have s.add taking two arguments. So it's hard to predict what that 3.0 stands for. However; the obvious typo that is present in the source code provided; that might very well be the cause of the failure; is in lines 299 and 301. In this segment of the code we're dealing with maxMiddleIndex and should really be getting values for our calculations from this.maxMiddleIndex; not this.minMiddleIndex. Because of this typo what we're actually doing is checking whether the middle value of our currently processed time period is greater than the middle value of the time period with the lowest middle value; which is incoherent with our logic and is sure to cause invalid results.,10,4,845EI-3g-3E700,5,Undergraduate_Student,6,21,Male,High School,United States,C#; C++

According to the web; these classes are from org.jfree.data.time on jfreechart.  The top line of SimpleTimePeriod is public class SimpleTimePeriod implements TimePeriod; Comparable; Serializable. The top line of TimePeriodValue is public class TimePeriodValue implements Cloneable; Serializable so STP is not a subclass of TPV and you are showing us the wrong add method.

The documentation says ""Returns the index of the time period with the maximum middle milliseconds."" there is only one time period in this set so its gotta be the index of this time period.
