The bug might be caused by attempting to call getClass() on a null value at array index 1.
The bug might be caused by calling getClass() on a null value at array position 1.
The bug occurs when the for-loop attempts to access array elements without checking for null values, leading to a potential NullPointerException.
The bug happens because the code is trying to access array elements that might be null without checking for it first, leading to a NullPointerException when calling getClass() on a null element.
The bug occurs because the code tries to dereference a null value in an array without checking for null first, causing a NullPointerException. A null check should be added before accessing array elements.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null value in the array. Specifically, when the loop reaches array[1], it tries to access getClass() on a null, resulting in a NullPointerException. A null check before calling getClass() should be added to avoid this.
The bug occurs because the code tries to call getClass() on a null value in an array. Specifically, when iterating through the array, it doesn't check if an element is null before calling getClass(), leading to a NullPointerException. To fix it, add a null check before dereferencing the array element.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element within an array, leading to a NullPointerException. A null check should be added before calling getClass() to ensure the element is not null.
The bug occurs when the code attempts to call getClass() on a null object in the array, causing a NullPointerException. To fix it, include a null check before calling getClass() on array elements.
The bug occurs when the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in the array. A null check should be added to prevent this, ensuring that getClass() is only called on non-null elements.
The bug occurs when the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in the array, causing a NullPointerException. To fix this, ensure the loop checks if array[i] is null before calling getClass(). If it's null, handle it appropriately (e.g., set the corresponding classes[i] to null).
The bug occurs when the code tries to call getClass() on a null object in the array. To fix it, ensure that before calling getClass(), there's a null check for each element in the array (i.e., if array[i] is null, skip the call and set classes[i] to null).
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in the array, which results in a NullPointerException. A null check should be added before dereferencing the array element.
The bug occurs when the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in an array without checking if the element is null first. This results in a NullPointerException. To fix it, add a null check before calling getClass() to prevent the exception.
The bug occurs when the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in the array, leading to a NullPointerException. A null check should be added before accessing the class.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in the array, which causes a NullPointerException. The solution is to add a null check before calling getClass(). If the element is null, set the corresponding class to null instead.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null value in the array, leading to a NullPointerException. To fix this, add a null check before calling getClass(). If the array element is null, set the corresponding class entry to null instead.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null value in the array, which causes a NullPointerException. To fix it, add a null check before calling getClass().
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in an array, causing a NullPointerException. A null check should be added before calling getClass() to avoid dereferencing null.
The bug occurs when trying to call .getClass() on a null element in the array, which causes a NullPointerException. This happens because there is no null check before dereferencing array elements in the loop. To fix this, ensure a null check is performed before calling .getClass().
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null element in the array, leading to a NullPointerException. To fix this, add a null check before calling getClass() to avoid dereferencing null values.
The bug occurs because the code tries to call getClass() on a null element in the array. This causes a NullPointerException when the second element of the array is null. A null check should be added before calling getClass() to avoid this error.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null object in the array, causing a NullPointerException. To fix it, add a null check before calling getClass() on each element in the array.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null object within an array. Specifically, when array[i] is null, calling getClass() causes a NullPointerException. To fix this, add a null check before calling getClass(). If array[i] is null, set the corresponding class value to null instead.
The bug occurs because the code attempts to call getClass() on a null object in the array, which throws a NullPointerException. To fix it, ensure that the array element is not null before calling getClass(). Add a null check in the loop: classes[i] = array[i] == null ? null : array[i].getClass();.
