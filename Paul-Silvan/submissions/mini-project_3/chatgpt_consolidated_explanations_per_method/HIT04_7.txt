The bug occurs because maxMiddle is calculated incorrectly when s and e are integers, causing rounding issues. This results in the wrong comparison when checking if (middle > maxMiddle). To fix, ensure proper integer handling when calculating maxMiddle.
The bug occurs because the calculation for maxMiddle might be incorrect due to integer division truncation. To fix it, ensure that the division is done with floating point numbers or adjust the formula to account for integer rounding errors.
The bug occurs because the calculation of maxMiddle is incorrect. It should be long maxMiddle = s + (e - s) / 2.0 instead of using integer division, which truncates the result.
The bug is that the calculation of maxMiddle is incorrect because it's based on s and e, but the condition checks if middle > maxMiddle. To fix it, ensure that maxMiddle is correctly calculated and that maxMiddleIndex is updated with the correct value. Also, replace 3.0 with 1.0 as needed.
The bug is likely due to incorrect or confusing variable names, which makes it harder to identify where the issue lies. The calculation of maxMiddle might be wrong, and there may be a mix-up between maxMiddleIndex and minMiddleIndex when referencing the period's end time. Simplifying variable names and ensuring the correct index is used should fix the issue.
The bug is caused by using the wrong variable (minMiddleMindex) instead of maxMiddleIndex when calculating the end time, leading to an incorrect value for maxMiddleIndex. The variable names are unclear, which makes it harder to catch these types of errors.
The bug occurs because the variable maxMiddleIndex is being set incorrectly. The calculation for maxMiddle seems to be wrong, and instead of using the correct value for maxMiddleIndex, an incorrect variable (minMiddleIndex) is being referenced, which leads to issues when setting the correct value. Ensure that maxMiddleIndex is calculated correctly using the proper values (s and e).
The bug occurs because the variables s and e are incorrectly set when calculating maxMiddleIndex. Line 299 should initialize s using getStart() instead of getEnd(), and line 300 should correctly initialize e with getEnd().
The bug is caused by incorrect variable assignments for s and e when calculating maxMiddleIndex. On line 299, s should be initialized as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime();, and line 300 should be corrected to use long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();. The wrong variable names are causing an assertion failure.
The bug occurs because the code is using the wrong variable (`minMiddleIndex`) instead of `maxMiddleIndex` at line 301. This leads to an incorrect calculation of `maxMiddleIndex`, causing errors and assertion failures. To fix it, change `minMiddleIndex` to `maxMiddleIndex` on line 301, and ensure that the start (`s`) and end (`e`) times are correctly set using `this.maxMiddleIndex` for both.
The bug occurs because the variable s is incorrectly assigned a value, which causes an assertion failure. The correct value for s should be retrieved from this.maxMiddleIndex, not this.minMiddleIndex. Also, e is set using the wrong index. To fix, update line 299 to use this.maxMiddleIndex and line 300 to properly assign e from this.maxMiddleIndex.
The bug is caused by incorrect variable usage: on line 299, "s" should be set to `getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime()`, and on line 300, "e" should be set to `getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime()`. Also, line 301 mistakenly uses `this.minMiddleIndex` instead of `this.maxMiddleIndex`, which causes the assertion failure.
The bug is caused by using the wrong variable (minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex) when calculating maxMiddleIndex. To fix it, change minMiddleIndex to maxMiddleIndex on line 301. Also, update the values of s and e to be correctly derived from maxMiddleIndex on lines 299 and 300.
The bug is that the code uses incorrect variable names and values, causing logic errors. Specifically, on line 299, s should be set to the start time of maxMiddleIndex, and on line 300, e should be set to the end time of maxMiddleIndex. Additionally, minMiddleIndex should be replaced with maxMiddleIndex on line 301. The assertion in the test is expecting a count of 1, but the actual count is 3, so the expected value should be changed to 3.
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly uses minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex when calculating the end time. You need to replace minMiddleIndex with maxMiddleIndex to ensure the correct index is used. Additionally, s and e should be set using getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex) to correctly retrieve the start and end times. This should fix the assertion failure.

The bug occurs because the wrong index (minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex) is being used when setting the maxMiddleIndex on line 301. Additionally, s and e variables should be correctly initialized using getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime() and getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime(). Fix these variable assignments to prevent assertion failures.
The bug is likely caused by the use of incorrect variable names in the calculation of maxMiddleIndex. Specifically, on line 299, s should be set to the start time of maxMiddleIndex, and on line 300, e should be set to the end time of maxMiddleIndex. Additionally, on line 301, this.maxMiddleIndex should be used instead of this.minMiddleIndex. This is causing issues with the assertion and may lead to incorrect values being used in the calculation.
The bug seems to be related to the misuse of variable names. Specifically, on line 301, the code is using minMiddleIndex when it should be using maxMiddleIndex to properly calculate the correct index. Additionally, there are issues with the declaration of s and e on line 299 and 300, which should reference maxMiddleIndex instead of other variables. The variable e is also used in multiple places, leading to potential unintended changes. Correcting these references should resolve the assertion failures.
The bug is caused by incorrectly using the wrong variable (minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex) when calculating maxMiddleIndex. The variable s should be initialized as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime(), and e should be long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime(). Ensure that these changes are made to prevent assertion failures related to maxMiddleIndex.
The bug occurs because the code mistakenly uses minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex at line 299, which leads to incorrect comparisons and calculations.
