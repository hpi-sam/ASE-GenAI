The for loop runs up to "consumed," but "pos" can go beyond the input's end since there are no checks to prevent it.
The issue is that the for loop is limited by `consumed`, but `pos` increments without checking if it exceeds the input size, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.
The bug is that the for loop doesn’t properly check for the end of the input, allowing pos to potentially go past it. Also, on line 95, there’s an unnecessary space between pos and +=, which could be causing a syntax issue or exception.
The bug occurs because the for loop is not checking if pos exceeds the input's end, and there may be an issue with the syntax on line 95 where pos is incremented. The space between pos and += might be causing an exception.
The bug occurs because the "pos" variable can exceed the input length, causing an out-of-bounds error. The for loop has no checks to prevent "pos" from going past the input's end. Additionally, there's a syntax issue on line 95 with a space between "pos" and "+=" that might be throwing an exception.
The bug likely occurs because the pos variable can exceed the length of the input array, causing an index out of bounds issue. Specifically, on line 95, the increment syntax may be incorrect (pos += instead of pos += ), leading to an exception.
The bug occurs because the `pos` variable is being incremented faster than the input is consumed, potentially causing it to exceed the input length. This happens in the for loop, where `pos` is incremented without proper bounds checks, leading to an error when accessing the input array.
The bug occurs because the `pos` variable is incremented faster than the input is consumed in the for loop on line 94. This causes `pos` to potentially exceed the length of the input, resulting in an out-of-range error when accessing the input on line 95.
The bug occurs because the `pos` variable is incremented faster than the input is being consumed, potentially causing it to exceed the input length and go out of range, leading to an error when accessing the array.
The bug occurs because the variable pos is being incremented without proper checks, which can cause it to exceed the length of the input array. This leads to an IndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing the input on line 95. To fix it, ensure pos does not exceed the length of the input while the loop is running.
The bug is caused by the pos variable being incremented without checking if it exceeds the length of the input. As a result, pos can become larger than the input size, causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessed later in the code. The issue is likely in the for loop, where pos is incremented too fast without proper bounds checking.
The bug occurs because pos is being incremented without proper bounds checking, potentially causing it to exceed the length of the input. This results in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on line 95, where the program tries to access an invalid index. The issue is likely related to handling surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding.
The bug occurs because pos is being incremented too quickly, potentially going beyond the input length. This happens because on line 89, pos is incremented by 1 for each character, but the loop on line 94 checks pt < consumed, which can cause pos to exceed the input size and lead to a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on line 95. This happens particularly with multi-byte characters, like UTF-8/UTF-16 surrogate pairs.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is being incremented without proper checks, potentially exceeding the length of the input string. This leads to an IndexOutOfBoundsException when attempting to access the string at an invalid position, especially in scenarios involving surrogate pairs or variable byte-length characters. To fix this, ensure pos stays within the bounds of the input during the loop.
The bug occurs because pos is being incremented too quickly, potentially exceeding the length of the input string. Specifically, pos is incremented in line 89, but there is no check to ensure it doesn't go beyond the string's bounds. This causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when pos is used in line 95 to access the input. To fix this, ensure that pos doesn't exceed the input length before accessing it.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is being incremented without proper bounds checking, causing it to exceed the input length. This results in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing the input array. Specifically, the pos variable may grow faster than the actual consumed characters, leading to invalid index access.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is incremented faster than the input is consumed, potentially exceeding the input length. This causes an index out of bounds error when trying to access characters at invalid positions in the input string, especially when dealing with variable-length characters like UTF-8 or UTF-16 surrogate pairs. Adding a check to ensure pos does not exceed the input length will prevent this error.
The bug is that the pos variable is being incremented without proper checks, causing it to exceed the length of the input string. This leads to an IndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing characters past the input's end, particularly on line 95 where pos is used to index into the input. To fix this, ensure that pos does not exceed the input length by adding boundary checks.
The bug is caused by the variable pos being incremented too much in the loop, leading it to exceed the length of the input string, causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. This happens because pos is incremented without checking whether it has gone past the end of the string, especially in scenarios where surrogate pairs or variable-length characters like UTF-8 are involved.
The bug is that the pos variable is incremented too quickly, potentially exceeding the length of the input string. This results in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to access input at an invalid position. The issue seems to occur in the for loop around lines 94-95, where pos is being incremented without checking if it exceeds the string length.
The bug is caused by the pos variable being incremented without proper bounds checking, causing it to exceed the length of the input string. This results in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to access a character at an invalid position, likely at line 95. The loop increments pos too quickly, possibly beyond the input's length, without ensuring it stays within valid bounds.
The bug is in the for loop where pos is being incremented without checking if it exceeds the input length. The pos variable can become larger than the length of the input, causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessed at line 95. This happens because pos is being incremented too quickly, especially when handling UTF-16 characters that might require two positions, leading to out-of-range access.
The bug occurs because pos is being incremented without checking if it exceeds the length of the input string. This leads to an invalid index when accessing the input, causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error. Specifically, pos can exceed the valid range, especially when handling surrogate pairs in Unicode. The issue is likely in the for loop where pos is incremented without bounds checking.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is incremented in a way that can exceed the length of the input array, causing an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Specifically, in the loop, pos is incremented without sufficient checks, which can result in accessing positions beyond the array bounds, especially when dealing with characters that have variable byte sizes, like in UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is being incremented without properly checking if it exceeds the length of the input array, causing it to go out of bounds. Specifically, on line 95, pos is incremented past the valid range of the input string, which leads to a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. This is due to the handling of Unicode surrogate pairs, where pos can exceed the string length if characters are 2 bytes long, leading to an invalid index.
The bug is caused by the pos variable being incremented too much, potentially going beyond the length of the input string. In some cases, particularly when handling UTF-8 characters that require multiple bytes, the code does not properly check if pos exceeds the string bounds. This causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when trying to access a character position beyond the input length, especially in line 95. The issue arises because pos is incremented without ensuring it stays within valid index limits.
The bug occurs because the variable pos is being incremented beyond the length of the input string. Specifically, pos is being incremented in a loop, but there is no check to ensure it stays within bounds. When pos exceeds the input's length, accessing the string at that position causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. This issue is likely related to handling Unicode characters, where pos may be incremented by 2 (due to surrogate pairs), potentially causing it to go out of bounds when the loop continues.
The bug is caused by the pos variable being incremented too much in the loop, leading it to exceed the bounds of the input string. Specifically, pos can become larger than the string length, causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessed later in the code (such as on line 95). This happens because pos is being incremented at a faster rate than the characters in the input, and there are no checks to prevent it from going out of range.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is being incremented without properly checking if it exceeds the length of the input string. This happens especially when handling surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding, where a character might be two code units long. As pos gets incremented past the valid range of the string, it causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on line 95. To fix this, ensure that pos does not exceed the length of the input before attempting to access characters at that position.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is being incremented too much, potentially surpassing the length of the input string. This happens because pos is increased on lines 89 and 95, without checking whether it exceeds the string's bounds, causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. The issue is likely with handling surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding, where charCount can return 2 for characters that should only take one index. This makes pos larger than the input length, leading to an invalid index when accessing the string.
The bug occurs because the pos variable is being incremented without proper bounds checking, causing it to exceed the length of the input string. This leads to a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when attempting to access characters at invalid positions, especially when handling multi-byte Unicode characters like surrogate pairs. Specifically, pos can grow too large when incremented in line 89, and later, in line 95, attempts to access positions beyond the string’s length. Proper validation or limits should be added to prevent pos from exceeding the input's length.
