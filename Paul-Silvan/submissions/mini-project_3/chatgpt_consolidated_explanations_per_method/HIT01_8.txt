The bug occurs because the condition minutesOffset < 0 throws an exception when the value is -15, which is less than 0.
The bug occurs at line 279, where the condition "minutesOffset < 0" throws an exception due to a negative value (e.g., -15) for minutes. This issue may be related to non-native Java handling.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception, but the value -15 is less than 0, triggering the exception. The issue seems to stem from outdated comments that don't reflect the current code.
The bug occurs because the condition minutesOffset < 0 correctly throws an exception when minutesOffset is -15, but the code was updated to reflect changes in the comments, which aren't consistent with the actual implementation.
The bug occurs because line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception, but the value -15 is less than 0, causing the exception. The code should instead check if minutesOffset < -59 to avoid this issue.
The bug occurs because line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0, which throws an exception when the value is -15. It should instead check if minutesOffset < -59 to avoid triggering the exception for values like -15.
The bug occurs because line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0, and since the value is set to -15, it triggers an exception. The check should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 to allow for valid values in the range of -59 to 59 minutes.
The bug occurs because the code throws an exception when minutesOffset is less than 0, but it should instead check if it's less than -59. The error happens when minutesOffset is set to -15, which causes the exception on line 279. The fix is to update the condition to check for values less than -59 instead of less than 0.
The bug occurs on line 279, where the condition checks if minutesOffset < 0. This throws an exception when the value is -15, but it should instead check if minutesOffset < -59 to allow valid values between -59 and 59.
The bug occurs on line 279, where the code checks if minutesOffset < 0, but the valid range for minutes should be between -59 and +59. The condition should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59 to fix the issue.
The bug is caused by the conditional check on line 279, which throws an exception if minutesOffset < 0. The value -15 is less than 0, triggering the error. The check should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 to allow for valid minute offsets between -59 and 59.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0 on line 279, which throws an exception for values like -15. The condition should be updated to check if minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59 to allow valid values between -59 and +59.
The bug occurs because the code at line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0, but the value should be between -59 and 59. The condition is incorrectly throwing an exception for values like -15, which are valid. It should be updated to if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59).
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0, which throws an exception when the value is -15. The condition should instead check if the value is outside the valid range of -59 to 59, i.e., minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59.
The bug occurs on line 279, where the code checks if minutesOffset < 0. Since -15 is less than 0, it throws an exception. The check should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59 to allow valid values for minutes offset between -59 and 59.
The bug occurs because line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0 to validate the minute value. Since minutesOffset is -15, the condition fails and throws an exception. It should check if minutesOffset is less than -59 or greater than 59 instead.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset is less than 0, but it should check if itâ€™s between -59 and 59. The current check throws an exception for values like -15, which are valid for minute offsets but not properly handled by the conditional.
The bug occurs because the code on line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception, but the value of -15 for minutesOffset is valid within the expected range of -59 to 59. The condition should be updated to if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) to properly handle values within this range.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0 on line 279, but it should be checking if minutesOffset < -59 to properly handle negative minute values, like -15. This causes an exception when values outside the valid range (-59 to 59) are provided.
The bug occurs because the code on line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0, but the comment indicates the valid range should be between -59 and 59. The code should be updated to check if minutesOffset < -59 instead of just < 0 to avoid throwing an exception for valid negative values like -15.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0 on line 279, throwing an exception for negative values like -15. It should instead check if the value is outside the valid range of -59 to 59.
The bug occurs because the check on line 279 only verifies if minutesOffset is less than 0, which fails when the value is -15. The correct range should be between -59 and 59, so the condition should be updated to if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59).
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0, but the valid range for minutes should be between -59 and 59. The check is incorrectly set to throw an exception for any value below 0, causing a Minutes out of range error when the value is -15. The condition should be updated to check for minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59.
The bug is caused by an incorrect check on line 279 where the code throws an exception if minutesOffset is less than 0. The value passed is -15, which triggers the error, but the comment suggests it should allow values between -59 and 59. The condition should be updated to check if minutesOffset is less than -59 or greater than 59 instead of just less than 0.
The bug occurs because line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0, but the valid range for minutes should be between -59 and 59. Since -15 is less than 0, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. The condition should be updated to check for minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59.
The bug is caused by an incorrect check in line 279, which throws an exception when minutesOffset is less than 0. However, the valid range for minutesOffset should be between -59 and 59, as stated in the comments. The check should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59 to properly handle negative values like -15.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0 on line 279, which throws an exception when a negative value, like -15, is passed. The correct condition should be minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59, as valid values for minutesOffset range from -59 to 59.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0, which causes an exception to be thrown when the value is negative, such as -15. However, the valid range for minutesOffset should be between -59 and 59, not just above 0. To fix the issue, the check should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59.
The bug occurs because the code checks if minutesOffset < 0 on line 279, which throws an exception when the value is negative (e.g., -15). The check should instead ensure the value is between -59 and +59, as specified in the comments. The condition should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59.
The bug occurs because the code on line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception, but the valid range for minutesOffset should be between -59 and 59. Since the code does not allow negative values for minutes (such as -15), it throws an exception incorrectly. The check should be updated to minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59.
The bug occurs because line 279 checks if minutesOffset < 0, but minutesOffset can be a negative value within a valid range (e.g., -15). The condition should be updated to if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) to correctly handle negative values when hours are also negative.
