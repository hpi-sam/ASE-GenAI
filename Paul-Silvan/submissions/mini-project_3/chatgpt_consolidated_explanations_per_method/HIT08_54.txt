The bug occurs when "fr__POSIX" has two underscores, causing an exception to be thrown when accessing the character at index 3.
The bug occurs when "fr__POSIX" has two underscores, causing an exception when accessing the character at index 3. The value "_" is assigned to ch3, leading to a failure in line 115 because it is not a valid letter (A-Z).
The bug occurs because if "fr__POSIX" has two underscores, the character at index 3 causes an exception due to being assigned a non-letter value. An else statement is also missing in the code.
The bug occurs when "fr__POSIX" has two underscores; it causes an exception at index 3 because the character is not a letter between A and Z. Add an else statement to handle this case.
The bug occurs when ch3 is an underscore ("_"), which is assigned to a variable and causes an error on line 115, as the code expects ch3 to be a letter between A-Z. An else statement is missing to handle this case properly.
The bug occurs because ch3 is assigned the value "_" (underscore) at line 113, and in the if statement at line 115, the check for ch3 being greater than 'Z' causes an exception. The underscore character is incorrectly treated as greater than 'Z', triggering the failure. An else statement is missing to handle this case properly.
The bug occurs because the third character (ch3) of the locale is an underscore ("_"), which has an ASCII value greater than 'Z'. This causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' in line 115 to evaluate as true, throwing an exception.
The bug occurs because the character at index 3 of the "fr__POSIX" string is an underscore ("_"), which has a higher ASCII value than 'Z'. This causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' in line 115 to trigger an exception, as the code expects a letter between 'A' and 'Z'.
The bug occurs because the code expects the third character (ch3) in the locale string to be a letter between 'A' and 'Z', but it encounters an underscore (_), which causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' to evaluate as true. This results in an exception being thrown at line 115-116. To fix this, the code should handle underscores correctly or update the check for ch3.
The bug occurs when the third character of the locale string is an underscore ("_"), as it causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' to be true and throws an exception. The code assumes ch3 will always be a capital letter, but an underscore has a greater ASCII value than 'Z', triggering the failure. This happens at lines 115-116, and the bug is specific to locales with an underscore in the third position.
The bug occurs when the third character in the locale string is an underscore ("_"), which has an ASCII value greater than 'Z'. This causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' in line 115 to evaluate as true, leading to an exception being thrown. To fix this, ensure the code correctly handles underscores in the locale string.
The bug occurs because the third character of the locale string, which is expected to be an uppercase letter (A-Z), is an underscore ("_"). Since an underscore has an ASCII value greater than 'Z', it triggers an exception in the conditional check on line 115 when it evaluates "ch3 > 'Z'". This causes a failure when processing certain locale formats like "fr__POSIX".
The bug occurs because the third character in the locale string, an underscore ("_"), is incorrectly processed as a valid character. The check at line 115 expects the character to be a letter between 'A' and 'Z', but an underscore has a greater ASCII value than 'Z', causing the condition to throw an exception.
The bug occurs when the third character in the locale string is an underscore (""). The code checks if this character is between 'A' and 'Z', but since "" has a higher ASCII value than 'Z', it causes an exception to be thrown at line 116. The check should account for non-alphabetical characters in this position.
The bug occurs because the character at index 3 of the locale string (which is an underscore "") is being compared to letters A-Z in line 115. Since "" has an ASCII value greater than 'Z', the condition fails and throws an exception. To fix it, ensure the locale string format strictly adheres to the requirement of using uppercase letters in this position.
The bug occurs because the third character (ch3) in the input string fr__POSIX is an underscore (_), which falls outside the allowed range of A-Z. This causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' in the if statement on line 115 to evaluate as true, triggering an exception. To fix this, the code should handle cases where the country code is omitted, or explicitly validate the input format to ensure compliance.
The bug occurs because the third character (ch3) in the locale string (e.g., "fr__POSIX") is an underscore ("_"), which falls outside the expected range of A-Z. This causes the condition on line 115 (ch3 > 'Z') to evaluate as true, triggering an exception. The issue arises because the input format for the locale string allows underscores at this position, but the code expects a strict format where ch3 must be an uppercase letter.
The bug occurs because the third character (ch3) in the locale string "fr__POSIX" is an underscore ('_'), which falls outside the expected range of uppercase letters A-Z. This causes the conditional check on line 115 (ch3 > 'Z') to evaluate as true, leading to an exception being thrown. The code assumes the input follows the format cc__CCCCC, where the third and fourth characters represent a valid country code in uppercase, but the input violates this requirement.
The bug occurs because the input string fr__POSIX does not follow the expected locale format cc__CCCCC, where the third and fourth characters must be part of a valid uppercase country code. In this case, ch3 is assigned the underscore _ at line 113, which fails the validation on line 115 because _ is outside the range of 'A'-'Z', causing an exception to be thrown.
The bug occurs because the input string 'fr__POSIX' does not meet the expected format where the third character (ch3) must be an uppercase letter (A-Z). Instead, ch3 is assigned the underscore ('_') character, which is outside the valid range. This triggers an exception on line 115 due to the conditional check ch3 > 'Z' evaluating as true.
The bug occurs because the third character of the input string (e.g., 'fr__POSIX') is an underscore ('_'), which falls outside the valid range of uppercase letters 'A'-'Z'. On line 115, the code checks if ch3 is not between 'A' and 'Z', and throws an exception when this condition is met. The input format expects the third character to be part of the country code, which must be uppercase.
The bug occurs because ch3, assigned as the third character of the input string fr__POSIX, is an underscore ("_"), which falls outside the range 'A' to 'Z'. The conditional check on line 115 (ch3 > 'Z') evaluates to true, triggering an exception. The input does not follow the expected format where ch3 should be part of the country code and must be an uppercase letter.
The input string "fr__POSIX" does not follow the expected locale format, where the third character (ch3) represents part of the country code and must be an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z'). Instead, it is an underscore (_). This causes the condition ch3 > 'Z' in the if statement on line 115 to evaluate as true, triggering an exception.
The bug occurs because the input string fr__POSIX does not meet the expected format. Specifically, the third character (ch3) is assigned an underscore (_), which is not a capital letter ('A'-'Z'). On line 115, the condition ch3 > 'Z' evaluates to true, causing an exception to be thrown. To fix this, ensure that the input string adheres to the format where the third character is a valid uppercase letter.
The bug occurs because the input string "fr__POSIX" does not follow the expected locale format. Specifically, on line 115, the third character (ch3) is an underscore (_), which falls outside the expected range of 'A' to 'Z'. This triggers the conditional check (ch3 < 'A' || ch3 > 'Z') and results in an exception being thrown. The code assumes ch3 should always be an uppercase letter, but consecutive underscores in the input break this assumption.
The bug occurs because the string "fr__POSIX" contains an underscore at the third position, which is not a valid uppercase letter as expected by the code. The check on line 115 (ch3 < 'A' || ch3 > 'Z') throws an exception because the underscore (_) is greater than 'Z'. The code fails when it encounters this invalid character in the third position, which is supposed to be a capital letter.
The bug occurs because the third character (ch3) in the string "fr__POSIX" is an underscore, which is not a valid uppercase letter. The validation at line 115 checks if ch3 is between 'A' and 'Z', but the underscore is outside that range, triggering an exception. This happens because the input format strictly expects uppercase letters for certain characters, and the underscore causes the failure.
The bug occurs because the third character in the input string (fr__POSIX) is an underscore (_), which causes a failure in the validation logic on line 115. The code expects the third and fourth characters to be uppercase letters, but an underscore does not satisfy this condition, leading to an exception being thrown when ch3 is checked to be between 'A' and 'Z'.
The bug occurs because the input "fr__POSIX" does not follow the expected locale format. The character at index 3 is an underscore, which is not a valid uppercase letter between 'A' and 'Z'. This causes the condition at line 115 to fail, resulting in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown. The code expects the third and fourth characters to be uppercase letters, but the third character is an underscore, which triggers the exception.
