The bug occurs when both the array and element parameters are null, causing the type to be set to Object.class. This results in an Object[] array being created instead of the expected String[], leading to a ClassCastException later in the code. To fix this, add a check to throw an IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null, and ensure the correct type is used for array creation.
