Answer:

The issue lies in the incorrect use of this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex in the method responsible for updating bounds. Specifically, the calculation for s and e incorrectly references this.minMiddleIndex, which leads to an inaccurate calculation of maxMiddleIndex. Updating these lines to use this.maxMiddleIndex resolves the problem, as it ensures the correct index is used for retrieving time period values.
