It's not clear if the program was meant to accept a negative number.  I can't answer the question without seeing the definition of this.lowerBound and this.upperBound.
g has to be 0-255. But you are passing in -0.5. I don't know the specifics of the lowerbound and upperbound on the min and max as I am not a Java class expert; but I reckon g comes out negative once the calculation plays out.
This does not appear to be an issue because a double is the default data type for decimals so this shouldn't be what is causing the error.
The color is out of the parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0
depending on the upperBound and lowerBound values; "g" might exceed -255 or 255 which is not a valid value for the Color object.
value is a double and is used as a double in the method. Both Math.max() and Math.min() use and return a double.
The variable "value" is incorrectly used on line 117; where the variable "v" should be used in its place. The variable "value" can exist beyond the range of "this.lowerBound" and "this.upperBound" and is causing this error.
there is an issue with colors in that programme 
It's hard to give an answer based on this small amount of code for me.  Generally I have to look at the larger code overall to see what's going on.
value really only has to be an int since valid values are forced 0 to 255 later.  I imagine it is a double for consistency with other color schemes used in other methods that may use the full range.    but by itself shouldn't cause any problem with any functions used in getPaint
no
The variable value seems to be fine; the value of the integer g seems to be not acceptable to Color constructor; which is throwing the illegalArgumentException. 
Nothing in this method checks that the lower range of value is positive -- therefore a negative number is not sanitized.
the argument value is defined correctly and used correctly
The argument value is checked against the lowerBound and upperBound variables; but the resulting variable v is never used in the code. Therefore; the value being -0.5 in this case results in a negative integer value; which is outside the expected 0 to 255 range for a color.
There is a problem with the argument  public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.
The variable is being defined correctly as a parameter of the getPaint method.
You are calling the Color constructor with three float parameters so the values are allowed to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
fffffffffffffffffsfsfsssssssss
Problem is that v is defined; but never actually used.  v is guaranteed to be between the lower and Upper; but Value is not.  Should be using v instead of value in line 117
The exception is coming from Color; so it must be g that has a bad value.  I need to see the definition of this.lowerBound and this.upperBound to know what is wrong though.
I'm not sure if this is the issue but the fact that int g is being defined by (int) could be causing some kind of parameter error.
The calculation of g appears to result in a negative integer value if the parameter value is negative to begin with. Passing a negative g into Color would produce the error and there is nothing in the definition of g that seeks to prevent that. And the calculation certainly looks like it would come out negative in that scenario. Again without understanding the relevance of lowerbound and upperbound; I cannot be 100 percent certain; as a caveat.
should be a float number
variable "g" might be outside the range of the Color class acceptable range values.
g is the cast value of lb \ up - lb *255. As long as the input "value" and the lowerBound and upperBound values are correct g will be a int between 0 and 255 and work with Color(int; int; int).
While the variable "g" may be out of range when passed to the Color constructor; it is being used correctly in this context. The problem is the use of the variable "value" which is used to assign a value to "g".
i believe that some error there in that line 
the variable 'g' is defined properly in the code.
I can only guess at the upper and lowerBound variables. the code doesn't seem to care if the value passed is negative though otherwise it appears to be trying to force g in the range of 0 to 255 as an int. that might be a problem
no
Since the exception seems to be thrown up by Color constructor (seeing message - color parameter outside of expected range); there is a problem with the value of g.
There is nothing wrong with 'g' if you correctly sanitize 'value'
the variable g is properly defined and used. it is not related to the failure
g is an integer; which is acceptable when creating a new Color object; as the arguments require integers.
public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.    Methods inherited from class java.lang.Throwable  getCause; getLocalizedMessage; getMessage; initCause; printStackTrace; printStackTrace; printStackTrace; toString  
It looks like the variable "g" is being properly instantiated and the value it is being set to is being cast into an int.
no there is no issue.
FFFFFFFFFFFDS FFFFFFFFFFFFF
yes ... should be computed using v; not value.
