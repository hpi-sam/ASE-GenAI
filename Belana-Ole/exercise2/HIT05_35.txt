If array is null and element is null it sets type to object class. 
Same concept here you are trying to cast an object to an array and you are not allowed to do so.
That was my first impression; that the use of generics enforces type; and the copyArrayGrow1 method should return an object of type array; or the code will break. However; I could be wrong. 
No because type is a generic class that can be set to anything.
the template ends up with the class being type of string and the result is string[]
it should implicit cast to the type of the object returned.
I don't think "type" is a reserved word in Java.
I don't think there's a problem as Class<?> can represent a Class object of any type.
I do not know enough about arrays in JAVA to know if the failure is related.
The type should be directly inferred from the Template argument types. The array should be made of the type specified; not the getClass() of either the array or the element. 
While the Class type is correct; and the syntax is how type should be defined; the value that was returned by copyArrayGrow1 is an Object rather than a string. 
I do not believe Class<?> type in line 3288 is responsible for the failure because by writing Class<?>; you are declaring a Class object which can be of any type (? being a wildcard); and the failure is related to an object being casted as a string.  However; my reasoning should be taken with a grain of salt since I am still learning Java code myself after transitioning over from C++ and Matlab
Yes; as with the previous problems "type" gets set to the Object class when both "array" and "element" are null.
Yes; type gets set to Object when both parameters to add are null which is what causes the ClassCastException. 
Type of the variable "type" may be incompatible
There is no issue with the definition of the variable "type" that I can see
<?> is not defined.
type will be object when it should be string
We are passing Null values
ya it may be the reason but not clearly say the failure accoutered if the data interchange between two differed datatype variables if its not portable 
Both the first conditional statment and nested conditional statement are false; therefore the line sets the variable type=Object.class. Since the failure relates to an attempt to cast an object to a string; it seems that this could be where the type object is introduced and therefore may be related to the failure. 
I think that the array and string being null is likely to cause a problem in this case.
The inferred type for the array is Object. However; sa which will be bound to the return value has a type of String[]. As the error message states Java can not cast an Object array to a String array.
Not very sure; but the failure involves an object trying to be assigned to a String. No string involved in the line of code 3288
I believe it is the casting at 3290 that is the issue as copyArrayGrow1 returns an object.
element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class  -- the object is null so this is returning an Object type.    
I believe the error is likely to be somewhere in this line given that the failure is a class cast exception and this is the line where the classes are being retrieved. I'm not confident in which part specifically the issue is though.
I see no reason why the line of code in question should lead to an IllegalArgumentException. This line is specifically included to deal with null objects. Both stringArray and aString should be perfectly acceptable formats.
No troubles with the conditional; it's doing its job properly; its the casting thats causing the issue.
Doesn't seem wrong
type will end up being a class object after this example. Other than that; I'm lost.
no there is no issue
there is no issue
It doesn't have any logic to make sure BOTH cases don't fail (and thus one can be null.)
The double ternary operator and the "type = array != null" part are very confusing and hard to figure out.
the method public static Object[] add(Object[] array; Object element) Copies the given array and adds the given element at the end of the new array. The new array contains the same elements of the input array plus the given element in the last position. The component type of the new array is the same as that of the input array.    If the input array is null; a new one element array is returned whose component type is the same as the element; unless the element itself is null; in which case the return type is Object[] ==> so we would end up with java.lang.ClassCastException Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to Ljava.lang.String;
As mentioned before; we need to first verify that array parm is not null before using getClass on it so that there will be an instance that allows getClass to work. If it were me; I would write a simple if statement that's easy to understand.  The use of the : ? type statement is concise I guess; but when you start nesting them like this you're just begging for trouble; or just showing off in my not so humble opinion.
I THINK THIS ANSWERS
It is valid nested conditional clause;which getClass() depends on whether array!=null or null.
Yes; this is related to the failure (though not where the failure actually occurs). The logic here first checks the array type if it's not null; but because the array is null in our case; it sets "type" to a basic Object type. This value gets passed to copyArrayGrowl() which returns a copy of the array.     The "type" that's set in this line would usually be a backup value in case the array is null; but since the array is both null and the "type" value passed is a basic Object type; the array that's returned is an Object[] array; causing the failure later on.
There is an issue with this line; but it's because the type variable is set incorrectly on line 3288.
newArray is not a reserved name and the copyArrayGrowl method appears to return an Object of type Array; which is the cast to T[] which matches the newArray type.
I don't know; as I need the complete program
The code is passing the class type as null.
new array and copyArrayGrowl are different types; cannot equal each other
the creation of the new object array newArray copying the old array seems to be fine and not directly related to the ClassCastException
The type variable being used at line 3290 is set up at line 3288. There we see if array and element both are null; then it is set to Object.class. Object classes are not implicitly converted to Strings because this can fail if the Object does not convert directly to a String (it could; but maybe not - thus the fail).    So; you are expecting an IllegalArgumentException from add; but there is no coding of this. You might try throwing an error instead of using Object.class by default. Something on the lines of:    Class<?> type;  if (array != null) {    type = array.getClass().getComponentType(); // if it isn't an array class; fail  } else if (element != null) {    type = element.getClass(); // build the collection on this type otherwise  } else {    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Arguments must not both be null!");  }
There should not be T() before the newArray
You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null.  It works fine as long as one of the parameters are not null.
No. There is no problem with the definition or the use of definition of variable newArray. The problem lies on the line 19 of the copyArrayGrow1 method source code; where in our case the compiler will create an array of type Object and then return it. We can't cast an array that is created of type Object with no elements of any other type to type T[].
I can see that " T[] newArray = (T[]) copyArrayGrow1(array; type);" copies an array and adds the given elements to said array; but I'm unsure with the variable declared above.  The variable "type" is taken as an argument in declaring "newArray" and the variable is cast into type "T[]" that the two class variables must not be compatible. I'm honestly rather confused by "Class<?> type = array != null ? array.getClass() : (element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class);" In having an unknown class it seems that the method might not work with multiple unknowns. But I'm rather unsure.
Since the inputs are null; then return is an array of [null]. This cannot be cast to a type String.
The declaration of newArray fails when it is null as in the example.
Cannot establish relationship of "test" with the "source code"
well the generic is recognized to be a String type by the jvm but then the type value is Object
ArrayUtils.add() method accepts Object parameters only and not String. So using T type converts your runtime objects to String and not as Objects.  So modify the class to use Objects instead of T type for this operation alone. Use a cast check if required; but stick to Objects for this. Alternatively; you can write your own add() method if you want it to accept String readily.
No; it appears to be used as intended. The new array being build will have the first array combined with the new element. The second parameter will be the array type. 
I think this could be answered "Yes" or "No" legitimately.  The locus of the problem seems; to me; to be the choice of using a generic here; and particularly how it was typed in line 3288.  So; in that sense one might say that "No" there is not a problem.    However; this line we are examining in this equation; line 3290; does contain the definition of the variable "newArray" which is then able to be assigned the "offending" Object type.  So in that sense; there IS something wrong here with the use or definition of the variable.
Because a new object array is being copied to a string type array some elements of the array could not be cast appropriately.
i think new array value going to be null in this program ; it may be a cause of error
