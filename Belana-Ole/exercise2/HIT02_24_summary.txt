The "g" variable, scaled within a 255 range and cast to int, impacts the Color class, triggering IllegalArgumentException if bounds fail. this.lowerBound and this.upperBound inadequacies prevent sanitization, allowing negatives. Misusing "value" over "v" (line 117) worsens errors. Reliance on Math.max() and Math.min(), double types, and input consistency is emphasized. The Color(float, float, float) constructor and RuntimeException encapsulate broader dependency issues in parameter handling.
