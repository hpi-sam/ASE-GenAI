There is no reference to the variable 'pos' in the Exception. and the Exception type is not the same as above.
pos will always be less than length; so the code should run.
The issue is not in the pos variable; but in the len which tells the pos how far to go
the variable "pos" holds an integer value while the error deals with a call for the 3rd character in a String that only has 2 characters.
The input "\uD83D\uDE30" needs to be passed through the Class StringEscapeUtils as well.
You are simply initializing pos to be equal to 0
The instantiation of the integer value pos is not at issue
if pos is null and len is greater than null then there will be a result.
no mistake with that variable pos in the source code
I don't see where this calls a method named translate. I haven't used escapeCsv() before. A quick look at the online documentation says "Returns a String value for a CSV column enclosed in double quotes; if required.". Hmm. I looked at the source code for escapeCsv() and it calls ESCAPE_CSV.translate(). That isn't this translate tho. And besides that; the string doesn't contain excess commas or quote symbols or newlines. I looked up the two characters and neither appears to be a comma or quote or newline. They both showed up as an unknown character.
Ok I get it; it is an issue with index numbers being less than the length 
That line simply starts pos out at 0. If there's an issue with pos I don't think it's there as I can't think of any other starting point it should be started at.
Checking a character in the string with pos most likely causes an error since the error is a string out of bounds
On line 85; a recursive call is made to the function with an improper number of arguments and expecting a return value.
This looks correct.  The position variable should start at the first character; index 0.
There's no issue with the pos variable on the error. The variable only defines that starting point of the loop where to start reading a character and writing it in the Writer. The index out of bound error is caused by an index identifier that doesnt exist. For example it tries to read or get the 4th character in the word "Few". 
This is fine
No The Pos variable is the index variable to array begging. when the value is reach out of the len value the exception appear 
Related 'pos' there won't be any issue;'pos' is an index to write char sequence to writer.
have not come across the data type; pos.
I'm not sure exactly what is going on given the example code provided; but nothing in the block throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Could not find the solution
The while loop has a potential to be infinite if the array c is null (I believe Java allows arrays of size 0). 
I'm a little fuzzy on what is going on with this code because I'm not up on all the details of handling unicode but the purpose of this sections seems to be dealing with the fact that in things like UTF-8 sometimes you get characters that are one byte and sometimes 2. Anyway; the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable.    If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero.
The only place in the code where they are using arrays and dealing with array indexes; high probability of issue being present here
I don't have idea 
The function is not called there.
lines 84-97 reference character counts; which seems much more correlated to the concept in the failure of being out of range. It almost seems like the amount should be 0 and that is causing the error. 
I cannot find an issue; but I am not sure
Calling the translate method with in it's body .  
This code is probably the cause of the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error.  The String index out of range 2 message seem to indicate that the variable pos is going beyond the size of variable input. On each iteration through the loop; pos is being incremented but it could already be at the end of input; so after it is incremented again; pos is going to be invalid; causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error.
On line 95; there is a space between pos and += which I feel is the wrong syntax. Instead; it should be pos+=. I suspect this threw an exception.
Yes
I dont know because some of the values are not given in this function code sometimes may that can lead to a run time bug.
According to the syntax; there is no issue; but need to check with any  an illegal arguments from the complete program
pt can go out of range of the array
I can't see an obvious problem
Possibly. If "pos" somehow exceeded the length of the input string; I suspect that line 87 would throw the OutOfBounds exception; probably during the call to Character.codePointAt().
The error has to be in this block.  There seems to be another translate function defined that takes 3 arguments and returns an int so it's possible the error is in there. It's possible that pos is getting increased too much at line 95 also and the error is occurring at that line.
This is definitely where the problem is; but I'm not sure where.
The exception isn't being thrown by the source code below so it is occurring within a function that is being called in it. It is possible the codePointAt function is causing the error; but I'm not sure.
This appears to be an incremental loop that doesn't have any errors in it. I don't see what would be in here that would say something is out of range.
While I am not sure exactly what this portion of the program is trying to accomplish I believe that there is a high likelihood that it could cause the program to crash.  My thoughts are that on line 95 we are incrementing pos by a value associated with input; and then we are repeating this while an unrelated condition (pt < consumed) holds true.  I think there is a strong possibility this would cause us to step out of bounds on input and get the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException we see in the error.
It doesn't look like there's any indexing going on there.
There is no code to prevent pt++ from exceeding len (where len = input.length();)
pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range. 
The test doesn't use the related source code. Unless translate is called within another function that isnt provided there is no guaranteed way of knowing whether it is the source of failure or not.
I think this is a valid for loop; I am not very sure what line 95 is saying though.
looks fine to me there is a start and end to each for-loop
The test that was run does not appear to be calling the method given below. Therefore I must conclude that the for-loop between lines 94 and 96 is not causing the failure.
It might if the position it returns in the string isn't accessible
the for loop is limited up to the value of consumed; while pos is incremented; possibly past the end of input since there are no check conditions.
This could be the cause of the exception. 'pos' is continually incremented and used to point to a point in 'input'; without validating it is still in range it possibly is pointing past the length of the string
This for loop will terminate properly; but it is unclear whether or not the "pos" variable will have a valid value by the end of the loop. However; it is unlikely that this should cause the error.
Gotcha; I can number the lines now. There is nothing wrong with the for loop. The number of characters translated should be properly accounted for by codePointAt; so pos should be incremented accordingly for normal and unicode characters.
Not an expert but it would throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException rather than StringIndexOutOfBoundsException I would have thought; though the codePointAt is array processing. If the error is thrown here I would suspect it is due to line 89.
(just copied my last statement since it applies here as well); StringEscapeUtils is a java constructor with the method escapeCsv; translate isn't even being used at all in the assertion.
PT++ Should be PT+
The Int pt variable value is reach out of the consumed the exception accoutered. the string IndexOutOfBoundsException when the index value reach out of length it appear.  
..
If the codePointAt method returns a unicode character value greater than 0x10000; then charCount returns 2; which would be potentially added to pos to create a larger index value than the string length.
The invocation will call to inspect the input at positions that are out of range (pos)
The pos counter is being incremented in line 89 and line 95 within the while; so it could be incremented beyond the len variable.
This could throw the exception if pos exceeds len. I am not sure how such a state would be reached.
This method is not related to assertequals or stringescapeutils at all so it has no bearing; the issue will still be the Unicode escapes.
I just don't see it.
I don't notice anything.
It seems like a simple increment on the pos variable. 
Think So
That variable is not correct
I don't believe it is even reaching that section of code; I believe the error to be somewhere in the while loop. That for loop is just changing the pos variable after a successful run.
Yes; there is an exception with surrogate pairs; so there is an issue in line 95 which deals with surrogate pairs I think. Don't understand Unicode and UTF-16 handling well enough to pinpoint the problem. 
depending on the input; the "pos" could be longer than the length of the input.
Syntax is correct; it does not lead to string index out of range failure
charCount;codePointAt determines the number of char values needed to represent the specified character.
Why is this recursive? Unnecessarily complicated.  I wouldn't bother debugging; just recode it.  A very poor use of recursion.
as pos gets larger; it will go past CharSequence at given (input; pos)
As I said in my previous answer; I'm pretty sure the issue is with one of the Character.codePointAt method calls.  It also would require the "pos" variable to reach the value of 2 to have thrown the error listed above.  I can't figure out any way for the "pos" variable to reach a value of 2 and still execute another iteration of the loop (which might lead to the execution of line 87 and an exception there).  Each time the "pos" variable is changed (potentially to an invalid amount) the continue keyword sends the program back to line 84 where the "pos" value is checked against the "len" variable for validity.    Therefore; it seems that the only place where the exception could be coming from is line 95.
I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions; the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds.
Error is in line in lines 85-88
