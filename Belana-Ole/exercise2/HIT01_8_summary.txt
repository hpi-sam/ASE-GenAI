A coding error at line 279 in DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes rejects negative minutes like -15 using minutesOffset < 0, throwing IllegalArgumentException on line 280. While the method's comments permit values between -59 and +59 since version 2.3, the condition overlooks hour negativity when minutes are negative. A proposed fix is minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59. This flaw, generating "Minutes out of range," blocks subsequent methods from being invoked.
