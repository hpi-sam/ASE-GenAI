Strict validation by LocaleUtils.toLocale enforces locale formats: two lowercase letters, an underscore, two uppercase letters, etc. Line 113 assigns _ to ch3, breaking ASCII (_ > Z) and A-Z rules in lines 115-117, leading to an IllegalArgumentException. Example fr__POSIX fails format rules due to underscores and missing else blocks. Character-specific checks validate lengths, extensions, and indices.
