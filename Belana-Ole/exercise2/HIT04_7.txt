The tested code only adds one TimePeriod to the TimePeriodValues instance and therefore updateBounds is only called once at that point.  When called all of the index properties have been initialized to -1 and so therefore the else component of the referenced conditional is executed and the maxMiddleIndex should be correctly set to the input index.
In the initialization of e and s; the parameters for getDataItem is this.minMiddleIndex. It should be this.maxMiddleIndex
division with 0 does not work
this.maxMiddleIndex = index <--- In lines 305 AND 309 this part of the code is used... Honestly; I've only debugged fairly short code before. I guess; VERY short code--and because I was writing it; it was even easier to debug. 
No issues that I can see
I dont think anything unusual here the if conditions and the functions are in correct semantic manner.
This method doesn't have issues related the failure
to find a max middle index
As far as I can tell there shouldn't be an issue but that section is the only section in the code shown that deals with MaxMiddleIndex which is what the failure is caused by.
There are errors throughout this code.
public void add(TimePeriodValue item) wont get invoked since it takes only one argument whereas the test s.add(new SimpleTimePeriod(0L; 50L); 3.0) has two arguments here; so it means issue is somewhere else.

Is middle defined?
??!! both s and e are Long!  maybe just me; but this confuses (play with 's')! There is no TimePeriodValues in pgm.  TimePeriodValues s = new TimePeriodValues("Test");
Simple implication being performed here... No issues from what I see. 
The issue is before these lines as it does not have the correct assumption for the middle index
line number 299-302 should be like below :     long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart()                  .getTime();              long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();
I do not see a viable issue right away.
There do not appear to be errors with the clause. this.data.size() seems to be 4.
The code may be the reason for the failure. when reach the index low then 0 then the code will not be able to executed it expected one arg but it give the greater values 
There very well could be an issue in this variable definition; although I am not sure specifically what it would be.  There are  number of chained method calls here that would need to be examined in more detail in order to really determine if this is the cause of the failure.
There might be an error that makes the MaxMiddleIndex take the value of the index and cause the assertion failure.
s.add method expects one parameter of type timeperiod - in the test; the s.add method is called with two parameters.
long maxMiddle = s + (e - s) / 2;              if (middle > maxMiddle) {                  this.maxMiddleIndex = index;   
While by convention you should use easy to read names; the variable is being declared in conditional clauses that will not run at the same time.
i think; instead of 3.0; we need to put 1.0
You initialise count to 0; then you never change that value. You assert that it is expected to be 1. The method is behaving correctly.
middle index is returned from this part of the code
I am not sure.
No clue; only thing I can think is to throw new.
s should be defined as long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime()
no ideas
The definition of the variable had nothing to do with the error.
on the initialization; that section of code should not be entered as  this.maxMiddleIndex is still -1   in addition s is declared the same as that which should be returned in that declaration at  s = getDataItem().
Well; since I cannot see how "getDataItem" is defined within the class; I am not sure if it is throwing that error or not.  Plus; I don't see where there could be a try ... catch block that could throw the AssertionFailedError.  It could be something in the "getDataItem" method or one of the subsequent stacked method calls that are after it.  There is truly not enough code to make a decision.
I'm going to assume TimePeriodValues have a constructor that takes a String and first line is okay. However; I don't see an add method in TimePeriodValues that take a SimpleTimePeriod and a double.  I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.    There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below.  Also; I feel like I'm missing additional code if the output above is returned.
Error: Could not find or load main class undefined  
I don't know. Maybe because you have a global variable 's' and a local variable 's' but I looked it and Java supports 'variable shadowing' so I really don't know.
I do not know what is causing this failure. I see no issue with the variable "s" in the code below and I cannot re-create the failure.
I'm not this familiar with java
Presumably the recalculate method is called during initialization or at the very least the indexes are set to -1 at initialization. However; the may not be and that could be the issue. Also; presumably this.data is empty after initialization.    If this.data is empty than updateBounds will be called with an index of 0. The highlighted code doesn't even get executed if maxMiddleIndex = -1 as I expect. If for some reason maxMiddleIndex is >= 0 such that line 299 gets executed that line doesn't set or change maxMiddleIndex. The entire code block containing line 299 at best sets maxMiddleIndex to index which equals 0.    For the code to produce the results it does it would seem that maxMiddleIndex has to start with a value >= 0 and/or this.data has to start in a non-empty state such that the index passed into updateBounds is not 0.
I beleive the getTime will cause a problem; because you are trying to set s to be variable of type "long"; and getTime is going to return a time value. 
The function getMaxMiddleIndex() seems to be the problem and I don't see it in this code. 
The failure is caused by the fact that an assertion test was set to 1 on an index fetch on the one time period added to the TimePeriodValues. The index is set to 3; so any index range get function will return 3 at this point corresponding to that one time period's index; which will fail an assertion test looking for a 1. The function in line 299 won't play into this at all.
we are doing assertEquals(1; s.getMaxMiddleIndex()); which should give us an AssertionFailedError  if we did assertEquals(3; s.getMaxMiddleIndex()); than it would work
At line 299; variable "s" is declared which contributes to setting "maxMiddleIndex"
The method call on line 299 and on line 301 are being invocated on the wrong object. The object should be "this.maxMiddleIndex" instead of "this.minMiddleIndex".
There would be an issue cause the function add uses the updatebound with different var type
I really can't find the problem with the incovation. I am sorry.
Not aware of this error
I cannot see the getPeriod(); getStart(); or getTime() methods. It's possible that there is an issue with this line; because it's directly related to calculating the maxMiddleIndex value; but without looking into those methods; there is no way to tell.
You're initializing assertEquals to believe the count will be one; while the actual count is three.  You need to change the 1 to a 3 on assertEquals.
NO COMMENTS
it is very easy to execute the code and get the output
In the code; in the previous if; you are checking whether maxIndex is greater than 0; but then using MinIndex(L 298). You should check; before calling that code; whether it's within index. 
parameter for s is already set for 3 but expected value 1 so there is an issue
i dont know how I am expected to know the outcome of this program without the code for the function getmaxmiddleindex
At line 299; it should be "getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex)" instead of "getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex)". As the code is currently written; it compares a possible new maxMiddle against the current minMiddle; when it should be comparing against the maxMiddle on that line and the next line (299 and 300).
low version jdk not support
line 299 should be:      long s = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getStart().getTime();    and line 300 should also be corrected; otherwise there will be another assertion failure:      long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();
e is of type Long; which matches what is needed or can be cast appropriately.
I don't see why it would cause the error.
I am not familiar enough with some of the functions used to know if there is an issue.
When we are calculating maxMiddleIndex the value to be considered should be   long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();  instead  long e = getDataItem(this.minMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd()                  .getTime();  is used.  I think changing this value to maxMiddleIndex should work as the mean would be calculated properly.
The variable e is used in two locations which are both reachable by the program (because both minMiddleIndex and maxMiddleIndex are values that can both evaluate to greater than 0) and it can be changed unintentionally.
From looking at the source code; perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter. You are passing minMiddleIndex; though we are checking for maxMiddleIndex.
Variable is different 
variable "e" is used as a conditional to determine maxMiddleIndex 
I feel the expression in e should be changed.
There is nothing wrong with the declaration or assignment of this variable.
Seems like the right way to do it; but I may not have enough context.
I can't figure out how to calculate the s.getMaxMiddleIndex().
You would presumably want the end to refer to maxMiddleIndex.    long e = getDataItem(this.maxMiddleIndex).getPeriod().getEnd().getTime();
it not contion in the version of jdk
I don't think there should be any issue cause of e for above code
I believe that the line should use this.maxMiddleIndex rather than this.minMiddleIndex on line 301.
e is referencing minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex on line 301
The code there is fine.  The problem is elsewhere.
programming skill
e is the time in milliseconds. getDataItem need to return time in milliseconds ;so that it can be accommodated as long value in 'e' variable 
Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex. Since the assertion fails when checking the MaxMiddleIndex it is likely there is something wrong with the assessor functions or how the value they return is being manipulated.
It doesn't seem like there's an issue with line 301; when line 287 is the exact same thing.  It looks more like "s.add" in the test portion above should contain the value 1 instead of 3.0.
Difficult to point out
There does not seem to be an issue with the getDataItem; getTime; getEnd; get Period; and they seem to be in the correct order for an operation like that to happen
Code in and around line 301 contains a bug wherein minMiddleIndex is used instead of maxMiddleIndex; will result in a wrong maxMiddleIndex in general. However; for code example given above; I cannot see any way this bug causes the expects-1-but was-3 assertion failure. 
There appears to be missing code.
I believe it should be dealing with the maxMiddleIndex
using minMiddleMindex there ... ? whoops! maybe if the variable names were less insane and verbose (and the methods less verbose) then they would more easily catch errors like that.
I can not determine any issue with the method invocations on line 301.
The code is working in those areas; there are checks inplace to make sure the number is above 0.
At line 301 the argument of "getDataItem" should be "this.maxMiddleIndex" but is instead "this.minMiddleIndex".This call is part of a method that updates bounds for all index variables( "minStartIndex"; "maxStartIndex"; "minMiddleIndex"; etc)and more specifically the section of that code that updates the "maxMiddleIndex". Information that was retrieved using the "getTime" method erroneously retrieved it from the "minMiddleIndex" which led to bounds being updated incorrectly.
there is no clear invocation of functions
The issue is probably at line 304. There is no 'else' part for the 'if' check at 304 which can lead it to use values from previous iterations.
This call-chain is consistent with other lines that call the same.  My guess would be that there's a problem with one of the methods being called; not the chain itself.
i tested and i checked
The method invocation looks normal.  I see no issues at line 301 that raise any suspicion to me.
I'm not familiar with Java.
Cannot see the method getMaxMiddleIndex(); so unsure of what is happening.
You want to check for maxMiddleIndex to see if its value makes sense with the updated bounds. However; when calculating the maxMiddleIndex; you use this.minMiddleIndex instead of this.maxMiddleIndex as your index for retrieving the period. This should give you the wrong time span.
Yes; since the method invocations are part of an expression to get the value for variable e where its result impacts the value to set for the maxMiddleIndex variable. But there should be no issue or error on the usage of the method invocations. The error encountered is just a result of an assertion where the expected result is different from the one being returned.
