The @throws IllegalArgumentException comment is also referring to versions before 2.3.', 'In the code there is a check that 0 <= minutes < 60 and the minutesOffset is -15 which does not fall into these prarmeters thus throwing an Exception', 'There is a logical check for if minuteOffset is less than 0 or greater than 59 causing it to throw an exception because the value is out of bounds (negative number)', 'YES. The issue is on line 279 (as I explained in my first question; of which I misunderstood that I was only being asked about the specific issue; not generalized issue). On line 279 the variable \"minutesOffSet\" is parameterized to throw an exception if it is < 0 or > 59. Line 279 should read \"if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {\" because now the method can take in the number of minutes as a negative and will allow the method to properly progress to invoke/call further methods such as those asked about in the two previous questions.', 'The variable \"minutesOffset\" is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279. Any negative value for \"minutesOffset\" will throw this exception; while the documentation states that \"minutesOffset\" can be negative in some cases.', \"Again the issue remains that the parameter check for minutes at line 279 doesn't allow negative numbers  and thus throws the exception.  This needs to be changed to allow up to -59 (but only if hour is positive) if the comments are up to date ... plus possibly later code as well; but certainly that for starters. \", 'This variable contains a value of -15 as set by DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15).

The code specifically encounters the error on line 279 when it tests if minutesOffset < 0; (-15) which is the case; so it throws the error on line 280 : Minutes out of range: with the value provided for that argument -15.', 'As noted in the comments; valid input for minutes must be in the rage -59 to +59 but on line 279 of the source minutesOffset is checked for < 0.

Also noted in comments is that versions before 2.3 minutes had to be zero or positive. \"Minutes out of range: + minutesOffset\" is our error.', 'the variable should be defined as \"unsigned int\" if we expect it to be always positive', 'minutesOffset it is the offset in minutes from UTC; must be between 0 and 59 inclusive ', 'this is also an int; which is a signed value.', 'The second argument should be just 15', 'The value of minutes offset does not have valid argument as a result this method will not be called as and argument exception will be displayed.', \"yep; they are checking if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception; and as -15 <0; it gets thrown. looks like they updated the comments but not the code. and this is why comments are evil liars that can't be trusted!\", 'The error is stemming from line 279 because the value of -15 for minutesOffset is < 0.

Therefore the issue probably occurs before we reach this part of the code; such as when the arguments are passed into the method.', 'Yes; this line is exactly the one that produces the exception when minutesOffset is <0.

    "(Q 3.1) There are many different ways which we could use to measure the diversity of explanations. We could, for example, use the type-token ratio or the number of unique words in the explanations to measure the diversity of words used in the explanations. Since we did not get great results with the TTR in previous experiments, we will not use this approach. Instead, we want to regard the Shannon Entropy of the explanations. The Shannon Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty in a random variable. In our case, the random variable is the choice of words in the explanations. The Shannon Entropy is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(X) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \\cdot \\log_2(p(x_i))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(x_i)$ is the probability of the $i$-th word in the explanation. Shannon entropy measures the randomness or uncertainty in a distribution—in this case, the distribution of words in a text. Higher entropy means more unpredictability, while lower entropy suggests redundancy or repetition. The minimum entropy is 0, which occurs when all words are the same. The maximum entropy is the logarithm of the number of words in the text, which occurs when all words are equally likely. For normal written English, entropy usually ranges between 4 and 8 bits per word, depending on vocabulary richness."
