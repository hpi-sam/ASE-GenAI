Add to and if necessary adjust the current SQL query to also do this: “For each message, also return the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message and the time when they created the like.”

current SQL query:

WITH FriendAndForeignLikes AS (
    -- Step 1: Calculate total likes and foreign likes for each message

**ChatGPT:**

To adjust the query as requested and include the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message along with the time when they created the like, we need to expand the existing query. Here's how we'll proceed:

- Join the likes table with the person table: We need to get the names of the users who liked the messages.
- Identify the first foreign person who liked the message: We'll use an additional ROW_NUMBER() function to rank likes by creation date and filter out only the first foreign person who liked the message.
- Join knows to determine if a person is a direct friend or a friend's friend: We'll continue using the knows table to determine if the like comes from a foreign person.

Here's the adjusted SQL query:

```sql
WITH FriendAndForeignLikes AS (
    -- Step 1: Calculate total likes and foreign likes for each message
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,

                         FROM knows k 
                         WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid 
                               AND k.k_person2id = l.l_personid  -- Direct friend check
                         UNION
                         SELECT 1
                         FROM knows k1
                         JOIN knows k2 ON k1.k_person2id = k2.k_person1id

### Explanation of Changes:

- FirstForeignLike CTE:This CTE calculates the first foreign person who liked each message. It uses ROW_NUMBER() to rank the likes by creation date (l_creationdate). The NOT EXISTS condition ensures that only foreign likes are considered (i.e., those that aren't from direct friends or friends' friends).
- This CTE calculates the first foreign person who liked each message. It uses ROW_NUMBER() to rank the likes by creation date (l_creationdate). The NOT EXISTS condition ensures that only foreign likes are considered (i.e., those that aren't from direct friends or friends' friends).
- FinalResults CTE:This combines the data from the MessageRatios CTE with the first foreign like details from the FirstForeignLike CTE. We join on l_messageid and filter for only the first foreign like using AND ffl.rn = 1.
- This combines the data from the MessageRatios CTE with the first foreign like details from the FirstForeignLike CTE. We join on l_messageid and filter for only the first foreign like using AND ffl.rn = 1.
- Final SELECT:The final query selects the message ID, total likes, foreign likes, the foreign like ratio, the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message, and the timestamp of when they liked it.
- The final query selects the message ID, total likes, foreign likes, the foreign like ratio, the full name of the first foreign person who liked the message, and the timestamp of when they liked it.
- Ordering:The results are ordered by the foreign_like_ratio in descending order, as per the original query.
- The results are ordered by the foreign_like_ratio in descending order, as per the original query.

### Result:

For each message, this query will return:

- The total number of likes.
- The number of foreign likes.
- The foreign like ratio (foreign likes as a percentage of total likes).
- The full name of the first foreign person who liked the message (if any).
- The timestamp of when that person liked the message.

This query should meet the requirements you specified.
