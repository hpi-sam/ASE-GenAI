**ChatGPT:**

To understand how PostgreSQL might execute this query, here is a step-by-step breakdown of an estimated execution plan in PostgreSQL. Each WITH clause or subquery is outlined in the order PostgreSQL will process it, with the types of joins, sorting, and filtering steps it will perform.

### 1. Execution Plan for Each CTE and Final Query:

- CTE: MessageLikesScan: message table to retrieve messages with length greater than 100.Join: likes table on m_messageid to find likes associated with each message.Aggregate: COUNT(l_personid) per m_messageid (grouping by m_messageid).Output: m_messageid and total_likes.
- Scan: message table to retrieve messages with length greater than 100.
- Join: likes table on m_messageid to find likes associated with each message.
- Aggregate: COUNT(l_personid) per m_messageid (grouping by m_messageid).
- Output: m_messageid and total_likes.
- CTE: ExtendedNetworkScan: message table to get each message and its creator (m_creatorid).Join:First Level: knows table on m_creatorid = k_person1id to get friends.Second Level: Another self-join on knows to get friends-of-friends.Union: The results of both joins to create a comprehensive extended network.Output: m_messageid and person_id representing each friend or friend-of-friend.
- Scan: message table to get each message and its creator (m_creatorid).
- Join:First Level: knows table on m_creatorid = k_person1id to get friends.Second Level: Another self-join on knows to get friends-of-friends.
- First Level: knows table on m_creatorid = k_person1id to get friends.
- Second Level: Another self-join on knows to get friends-of-friends.
- Union: The results of both joins to create a comprehensive extended network.
- Output: m_messageid and person_id representing each friend or friend-of-friend.
- CTE: ForeignLikesScan: likes table to get each like and its l_personid.Left Join: ExtendedNetwork on m_messageid and l_personid to find likes from users outside the extended network.Filter: WHERE en.person_id IS NULL ensures only foreign likes are retained.Window Functions:COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY l_messageid): Counts foreign likes per message.ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l_messageid ORDER BY l_creationdate): Ranks likes chronologically to identify the first foreign like.Output: message_id, fl_creationdate, fl_personid, foreign_likes, and rn.
- Scan: likes table to get each like and its l_personid.
- Left Join: ExtendedNetwork on m_messageid and l_personid to find likes from users outside the extended network.
- Filter: WHERE en.person_id IS NULL ensures only foreign likes are retained.
- Window Functions:COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY l_messageid): Counts foreign likes per message.ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l_messageid ORDER BY l_creationdate): Ranks likes chronologically to identify the first foreign like.
- COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY l_messageid): Counts foreign likes per message.
- ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY l_messageid ORDER BY l_creationdate): Ranks likes chronologically to identify the first foreign like.
- Output: message_id, fl_creationdate, fl_personid, foreign_likes, and rn.
- CTE: FirstLikerFilter: WHERE rn = 1 to get the first like per message.Join: person table on p_personid = fl.fl_personid to get the name of the first foreign liker.Output: message_id, first_like_creation, and first_liker_name.
- Filter: WHERE rn = 1 to get the first like per message.
- Join: person table on p_personid = fl.fl_personid to get the name of the first foreign liker.
- Output: message_id, first_like_creation, and first_liker_name.
- Main Query (Final Output)Join:MessageLikes (ml) and aggregated ForeignLikes (fl) on ml.m_messageid = fl.message_id.FirstLiker (ff) on ml.m_messageid = ff.message_id.Filter:WHERE ml.total_likes >= 20 ensures only popular messages are included.AND fl.foreign_likes >= ml.total_likes / 2 checks for significant foreign engagement.Sort: ORDER BY fl.foreign_likes::float / ml.total_likes DESC to rank messages based on the ratio of foreign to total likes.Output: Selected columns from MessageLikes, ForeignLikes, and FirstLiker.
- Join:MessageLikes (ml) and aggregated ForeignLikes (fl) on ml.m_messageid = fl.message_id.FirstLiker (ff) on ml.m_messageid = ff.message_id.
- MessageLikes (ml) and aggregated ForeignLikes (fl) on ml.m_messageid = fl.message_id.
- FirstLiker (ff) on ml.m_messageid = ff.message_id.
- Filter:WHERE ml.total_likes >= 20 ensures only popular messages are included.AND fl.foreign_likes >= ml.total_likes / 2 checks for significant foreign engagement.
- WHERE ml.total_likes >= 20 ensures only popular messages are included.
- AND fl.foreign_likes >= ml.total_likes / 2 checks for significant foreign engagement.
- Sort: ORDER BY fl.foreign_likes::float / ml.total_likes DESC to rank messages based on the ratio of foreign to total likes.
- Output: Selected columns from MessageLikes, ForeignLikes, and FirstLiker.

### 2. PostgreSQL Execution Plan Elements

Below is a possible breakdown of the execution plan PostgreSQL might display for this query:

```sql
CTE Scan on MessageLikes
  -> Aggregate (count on likes table join with message)
  -> Filter: (m_length > 100)
  -> Group By: m_messageid

CTE Scan on ExtendedNetwork
  -> Nested Loop Join (message and knows table on m_creatorid = k_person1id)
  -> Union (friends and friends-of-friends relations)

CTE Scan on ForeignLikes
  -> Window Function (partition by l_messageid for foreign_likes count)
  -> Left Join (likes on ExtendedNetwork)
  -> Filter: (en.person_id IS NULL)

CTE Scan on FirstLiker
  -> Filter: (rn = 1)
  -> Join (person table on fl_personid)

Nested Loop Join (MessageLikes, ForeignLikes)
  -> Hash Join (ForeignLikes subquery on message_id with MessageLikes)
  -> Nested Loop Join (MessageLikes, FirstLiker)
  -> Filter: (ml.total_likes >= 20 AND fl.foreign_likes >= ml.total_likes / 2)
  -> Sort (fl.foreign_likes::float / ml.total_likes DESC)

```

### Explanation of Key Elements in the Plan:

- Nested Loop Join: Used where smaller intermediate results are joined, such as joining MessageLikes and FirstLiker.
- Hash Join: May be used for larger tables or aggregates, as in ForeignLikes with MessageLikes.
- Window Functions: Efficiently partition and order likes to calculate foreign likes and determine the first foreign liker.
- Aggregate Functions: Count operations and groupings within CTEs to ensure only the required data proceeds to the next steps.
- Sort: Final sort for ordering by the ratio of foreign to total likes.

This execution plan is a representative approach PostgreSQL might use based on typical optimization techniques for CTEs, joins, and filters.

                                                              ->  Index Scan using knows_pkey on knows k2  (cost=XXXXX.XX..XXXXX.XX rows=XX width=XX)
                                                                    Index Cond: (k2.k_person1id = k1.k_person2id)

  ->  Sort  (cost=XXXXX.XX..XXXXX.XX rows=XX width=XX)
        Sort Key: (fl.foreign_likes::float / ml.total_likes) DESC

```

### Explanation of Key Components in This Plan

- CTE Scans: CTEs like MessageLikes and FirstLiker are materialized and scanned as needed in the plan.
- Hash Joins: Frequently used for joining tables with hashed keys (e.g., joining MessageLikes with the aggregated ForeignLikes on m_messageid).
- Nested Loop Joins: Used for smaller, filtered subsets where nested loops are efficient, such as with knows in ExtendedNetwork.
- Window Aggregation: Applied in ForeignLikes for ROW_NUMBER() and COUNT() OVER, with ordering by l_creationdate.
- Filters: Checks like WHERE m_length > 100 and WHERE en.person_id IS NULL appear in filtering steps.
- Sorts: The ORDER BY for the final result ranks messages by foreign-like ratio, requiring a final sort operation.

This output format closely represents what EXPLAIN would generate, showing the costs and logical steps involved in each join, scan, and aggregation in PostgreSQLâ€™s query execution.

### Explanation of Each Cost and Row Estimate

- CTE Scans:MessageLikes ml: Estimated to have around 1,000 rows after filtering messages with length over 100, and total costs around 2500.00.FirstLiker ff: Filtered down to the first liker with an estimated cost of 2500.00 for the scan.
- MessageLikes ml: Estimated to have around 1,000 rows after filtering messages with length over 100, and total costs around 2500.00.
- FirstLiker ff: Filtered down to the first liker with an estimated cost of 2500.00 for the scan.
- Hash Joins:The join between ml and fl (Hash Join with a cost around 30000.00) assumes a join between MessageLikes and aggregated ForeignLikes on m_messageid.Hash aggregates and joins in ForeignLikes CTE estimate around 5,000 rows from likes, with hashing costs around 9000.00 for ExtendedNetwork.
- The join between ml and fl (Hash Join with a cost around 30000.00) assumes a join between MessageLikes and aggregated ForeignLikes on m_messageid.
- Hash aggregates and joins in ForeignLikes CTE estimate around 5,000 rows from likes, with hashing costs around 9000.00 for ExtendedNetwork.
- Nested Loop Joins:Nested loops used for ExtendedNetwork are efficient here, with knows entries providing links for friends and friends-of-friends.A deeper nested loop uses an index scan on knows_pkey (Index Scan using knows_pkey on knows k2 with low cost) to retrieve friends-of-friends.
- Nested loops used for ExtendedNetwork are efficient here, with knows entries providing links for friends and friends-of-friends.
- A deeper nested loop uses an index scan on knows_pkey (Index Scan using knows_pkey on knows k2 with low cost) to retrieve friends-of-friends.
- Window Aggregation and Sorting:The WindowAgg function for counting and ranking foreign likes adds cost due to sorting (cost=25000.00).Final sorting in the main query ranks by foreign-like ratio (Sort cost=5000.00) after filtering messages with substantial likes and foreign engagement.
- The WindowAgg function for counting and ranking foreign likes adds cost due to sorting (cost=25000.00).
- Final sorting in the main query ranks by foreign-like ratio (Sort cost=5000.00) after filtering messages with substantial likes and foreign engagement.

These estimates provide an example of how PostgreSQL might assign costs and row estimates in a real-world plan, guiding the optimizerâ€™s choice of join strategies and filtering steps.
