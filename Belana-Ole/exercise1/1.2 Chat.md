**ChatGPT:**

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into specific steps. The solution involves querying a database (or performing some kind of data processing) to identify messages that meet certain criteria and then sorting those messages according to specific conditions. Here's how we can approach it:

### Problem Breakdown

- Messages Longer Than 100 Characters: We are filtering messages based on their length. Only messages with more than 100 characters should be considered.
- At Least 20 Likes: We need to ensure that the message has at least 20 likes.
- At Least Half of the Likes Are From Foreigners:A foreigner is defined as a person who:Is not the creator of the message.Is not a friend of the creator.For this, we need access to both the creator’s identity and their friend list.
- A foreigner is defined as a person who:Is not the creator of the message.Is not a friend of the creator.
- Is not the creator of the message.
- Is not a friend of the creator.
- For this, we need access to both the creator’s identity and their friend list.
- Return Message ID, Total Number of Likes, and Foreign Likes:After filtering the messages based on the conditions, we need to return specific data for each message: the message's ID, total number of likes, and the number of foreign likes.
- After filtering the messages based on the conditions, we need to return specific data for each message: the message's ID, total number of likes, and the number of foreign likes.
- Sort the Results:The result should be sorted based on the ratio of foreign likes to total likes, from highest to lowest.
- The result should be sorted based on the ratio of foreign likes to total likes, from highest to lowest.

### Approach

We will need to assume the following structure and data relationships:

- Messages table or collection: Contains messages, their content, and a reference to their creator (user ID).
- Likes table or collection: Each like has a reference to the message and the user who liked it.
- Users table or collection: Contains user information, including friends.
- Friendships table or collection: Represents friendships between users (bi-directional).

### Steps to Implement

- Filter Messages by Length and Like Count:Query messages where the length of the message is greater than 100 characters.Filter out messages that have fewer than 20 likes.
- Query messages where the length of the message is greater than 100 characters.
- Filter out messages that have fewer than 20 likes.
- Identify Foreign Likes:For each like on a message, check if the user who liked the message is a foreigner:A user is a foreigner if they are not the message's creator.A user is a foreigner if they are not friends with the message’s creator.
- For each like on a message, check if the user who liked the message is a foreigner:A user is a foreigner if they are not the message's creator.A user is a foreigner if they are not friends with the message’s creator.
- A user is a foreigner if they are not the message's creator.
- A user is a foreigner if they are not friends with the message’s creator.
- Calculate Foreign Likes:Count how many of the likes are from users who are considered foreigners.
- Count how many of the likes are from users who are considered foreigners.
- Filter Messages Where At Least Half of the Likes Are Foreign:For each message, check if the number of foreign likes is at least half of the total likes.
- For each message, check if the number of foreign likes is at least half of the total likes.
- Return the Desired Data:For each message that meets the conditions, return the message ID, total likes, and foreign likes.
- For each message that meets the conditions, return the message ID, total likes, and foreign likes.
- Sort the Results:Sort the results by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.
- Sort the results by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.

### SQL Query Example

If this were implemented in SQL, a query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    m.message_id, 
    COUNT(l.like_id) AS total_likes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN u.user_id NOT IN (SELECT f.friend_id FROM friendships f WHERE f.user_id = m.creator_id) AND u.user_id != m.creator_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS foreign_likes
FROM messages m
JOIN likes l ON m.message_id = l.message_id
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE LENGTH(m.content) > 100  -- Filter for messages longer than 100 characters
GROUP BY m.message_id, m.creator_id
HAVING COUNT(l.like_id) >= 20
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN u.user_id NOT IN (SELECT f.friend_id FROM friendships f WHERE f.user_id = m.creator_id) AND u.user_id != m.creator_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= COUNT(l.like_id) / 2
ORDER BY (SUM(CASE WHEN u.user_id NOT IN (SELECT f.friend_id FROM friendships f WHERE f.user_id = m.creator_id) AND u.user_id != m.creator_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(l.like_id)) DESC;

```

### Explanation:

- Filter by Length and Likes:LENGTH(m.content) > 100 filters out short messages.HAVING COUNT(l.like_id) >= 20 ensures there are at least 20 likes.
- LENGTH(m.content) > 100 filters out short messages.
- HAVING COUNT(l.like_id) >= 20 ensures there are at least 20 likes.
- Calculate Foreign Likes:The CASE statement inside the SUM counts a like as foreign if the user is not the message creator and is not a friend of the creator.
- The CASE statement inside the SUM counts a like as foreign if the user is not the message creator and is not a friend of the creator.
- Ensure Half of the Likes Are Foreign:HAVING ... >= COUNT(l.like_id) / 2 ensures that at least half of the likes are from foreign users.
- HAVING ... >= COUNT(l.like_id) / 2 ensures that at least half of the likes are from foreign users.
- Sort by Foreign Likes Ratio:ORDER BY ... DESC sorts the messages by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes, from highest to lowest.
- ORDER BY ... DESC sorts the messages by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes, from highest to lowest.

### Optimizations and Considerations:

- Performance: If there are many users, messages, and friendships, performance might become a concern. Indexes on the messages, likes, and friendships tables (especially on user_id, message_id, and creator_id) could significantly improve query performance.
- Foreignness Definition: The query assumes that a "foreigner" is someone who is neither the message creator nor their friend. If the definition of foreignness is more complex, the query would need to be adjusted.
- Edge Cases: We need to handle cases where a message has fewer than 20 likes or where none of the likes are foreign.

This query provides a framework to solve the problem as stated, but depending on the exact schema and data relationships, some adjustments may be needed.

**ChatGPT:**

Thank you for providing the schema! With this schema, we now have a better understanding of the data model, particularly regarding posts, likes, and friends (via the knows table). Let's adjust the solution to reflect the specific table structure and relationships.

### Problem Breakdown (Adjusted for Schema)

- Filter Messages Longer Than 100 Characters:We'll focus on the message table, specifically the m_content and m_length columns, to find messages where m_length > 100.
- We'll focus on the message table, specifically the m_content and m_length columns, to find messages where m_length > 100.
- Messages with At Least 20 Likes:The likes table will help us count how many likes a particular message has. We'll only consider messages with at least 20 likes.
- The likes table will help us count how many likes a particular message has. We'll only consider messages with at least 20 likes.
- At Least Half of the Likes Are From Foreigners:To identify "foreigners," we'll check:A user is not the message creator (m_creatorid).A user is not a friend of the creator. This relationship is stored in the knows table, where k_person1id and k_person2id represent two people who are friends.
- To identify "foreigners," we'll check:A user is not the message creator (m_creatorid).A user is not a friend of the creator. This relationship is stored in the knows table, where k_person1id and k_person2id represent two people who are friends.
- A user is not the message creator (m_creatorid).
- A user is not a friend of the creator. This relationship is stored in the knows table, where k_person1id and k_person2id represent two people who are friends.
- Return Message Data:For each message that meets the criteria, we need to return:m_messageid (Message ID).Total number of likes.Number of foreign likes.
- For each message that meets the criteria, we need to return:m_messageid (Message ID).Total number of likes.Number of foreign likes.
- m_messageid (Message ID).
- Total number of likes.
- Number of foreign likes.
- Sort by the Ratio of Foreign Likes to Total Likes:We'll calculate the ratio of foreign likes to total likes and sort the messages by this ratio in descending order.
- We'll calculate the ratio of foreign likes to total likes and sort the messages by this ratio in descending order.

### Steps to Implement

- Filter Messages:We'll select messages from the message table where the m_length is greater than 100 and join with the likes table to count the number of likes.
- We'll select messages from the message table where the m_length is greater than 100 and join with the likes table to count the number of likes.
- Identify Foreign Likes:For each like, check if the user who liked the message (l_personid) is not the creator (m_creatorid) and is not in the knows table for that creator.
- For each like, check if the user who liked the message (l_personid) is not the creator (m_creatorid) and is not in the knows table for that creator.
- Calculate Foreign Likes and Total Likes:We will count the total likes and foreign likes for each message.
- We will count the total likes and foreign likes for each message.
- Ensure At Least Half of the Likes Are Foreign:We'll use a HAVING clause to filter out messages where fewer than half of the likes are foreign.
- We'll use a HAVING clause to filter out messages where fewer than half of the likes are foreign.
- Sort by Foreign Likes Ratio:Finally, we will sort the messages by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.
- Finally, we will sort the messages by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.

### SQL Query Based on Provided Schema

```sql
WITH ForeignLikes AS (
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_likes,
        SUM(CASE 
                WHEN l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid 
                     AND NOT EXISTS (
                         SELECT 1 
                         FROM knows k 
                         WHERE (k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid AND k.k_person2id = l.l_personid) 
                            OR (k.k_person1id = l.l_personid AND k.k_person2id = m.m_creatorid)
                     ) 
                THEN 1 
                ELSE 0 
            END) AS foreign_likes
    FROM likes l
    JOIN message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE m.m_length > 100  -- Filter for messages with length > 100
    GROUP BY l.l_messageid, m.m_creatorid
    HAVING COUNT(l.l_personid) >= 20  -- At least 20 likes
),
MessageRatios AS (
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        fl.total_likes,
        fl.foreign_likes,
        (fl.foreign_likes * 1.0 / fl.total_likes) AS foreign_like_ratio
    FROM ForeignLikes fl
    JOIN message m ON fl.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE fl.foreign_likes >= fl.total_likes / 2  -- At least half the likes are foreign
)
SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    fl.total_likes,
    fl.foreign_likes
FROM MessageRatios fl
ORDER BY fl.foreign_like_ratio DESC;

```

### Explanation:

- CTE: ForeignLikes:This common table expression (CTE) calculates the total likes and foreign likes for each message:COUNT(l.l_personid) gives the total number of likes.The SUM(CASE ...) calculates the number of foreign likes by checking if the user who liked the message (l.l_personid) is neither the creator of the message (m.m_creatorid) nor a friend of the creator (checked using the knows table).
- This common table expression (CTE) calculates the total likes and foreign likes for each message:COUNT(l.l_personid) gives the total number of likes.The SUM(CASE ...) calculates the number of foreign likes by checking if the user who liked the message (l.l_personid) is neither the creator of the message (m.m_creatorid) nor a friend of the creator (checked using the knows table).
- COUNT(l.l_personid) gives the total number of likes.
- The SUM(CASE ...) calculates the number of foreign likes by checking if the user who liked the message (l.l_personid) is neither the creator of the message (m.m_creatorid) nor a friend of the creator (checked using the knows table).
- CTE: MessageRatios:This CTE calculates the ratio of foreign likes to total likes for each message and filters messages where the number of foreign likes is at least half of the total likes (foreign_likes >= total_likes / 2).
- This CTE calculates the ratio of foreign likes to total likes for each message and filters messages where the number of foreign likes is at least half of the total likes (foreign_likes >= total_likes / 2).
- Final Select:The final SELECT retrieves the message ID, total likes, and foreign likes for messages that have passed the ratio filter.ORDER BY fl.foreign_like_ratio DESC sorts the messages by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.
- The final SELECT retrieves the message ID, total likes, and foreign likes for messages that have passed the ratio filter.
- ORDER BY fl.foreign_like_ratio DESC sorts the messages by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.

### Notes:

- Performance Considerations:The query uses subqueries and joins, which may be slow if the dataset is large. Indexes on likes.l_messageid, likes.l_personid, message.m_messageid, and knows.k_person1id, knows.k_person2id could help speed things up.
- The query uses subqueries and joins, which may be slow if the dataset is large. Indexes on likes.l_messageid, likes.l_personid, message.m_messageid, and knows.k_person1id, knows.k_person2id could help speed things up.
- Foreign Likes Calculation:The NOT EXISTS clause checks if a user is a friend of the message creator. If there's no record of the user being a friend, the user is considered a foreigner.
- The NOT EXISTS clause checks if a user is a friend of the message creator. If there's no record of the user being a friend, the user is considered a foreigner.
- Edge Cases:If a message has exactly 20 likes, but none of them are foreign, it will be excluded from the results.If a user is friends with the creator but likes the message, their like is excluded from the foreign count.
- If a message has exactly 20 likes, but none of them are foreign, it will be excluded from the results.
- If a user is friends with the creator but likes the message, their like is excluded from the foreign count.

This query should now work with the schema you've provided and meet the requirements of the problem statement.

**Du:**

Please adjust the code to also consider friend's friends as known and not foreign. Also, only consider the knows relationship unidirectional (currently you use the OR to check in both directions)

---

**ChatGPT:**

Got it! Based on your request, we need to adjust the query to:

- Consider Friend's Friends as Known: This means that if person A is friends with person B, and person B is friends with person C, then person C should also be considered "known" to person A (not a foreigner).
- Unidirectional knows Relationship: Instead of checking both directions in the knows relationship (using OR), we'll only consider the direction where one person knows the other. So if person A knows person B, we won't check the reverse (i.e., we won't consider if B knows A as a valid friendship for this check).

### Plan for Adjustments:

- Expand the Friendship Check:We'll need to consider friends of friends as "known," which means the query should account for not just direct friendships but also two-hop relationships (i.e., the friends of the creator's friends).
- We'll need to consider friends of friends as "known," which means the query should account for not just direct friendships but also two-hop relationships (i.e., the friends of the creator's friends).
- Adjust the knows Check:We'll remove the bidirectional OR and ensure that the relationship is unidirectional (k_person1id knows k_person2id).
- We'll remove the bidirectional OR and ensure that the relationship is unidirectional (k_person1id knows k_person2id).

### SQL Query Adjustments

```sql
WITH FriendAndForeignLikes AS (
    -- Step 1: Calculate total likes and foreign likes for each message
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_likes,
        SUM(CASE 
                WHEN l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid 
                     AND NOT EXISTS (
                         -- Check if the like is from the creator's direct friends or their friends' friends

    JOIN message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE m.m_length > 100  -- Filter for messages with length > 100
    GROUP BY l.l_messageid, m.m_creatorid
    HAVING COUNT(l.l_personid) >= 20  -- At least 20 likes

    FROM FriendAndForeignLikes fl
    JOIN message m ON fl.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE fl.foreign_likes >= fl.total_likes / 2  -- At least half the likes are foreign

FROM MessageRatios fl
ORDER BY fl.foreign_like_ratio DESC;

```

### Explanation of Changes:

- FriendAndForeignLikes CTE:Direct Friends: The first SELECT inside the NOT EXISTS clause checks if the liker (l.l_personid) is a direct friend of the message creator. This is done by checking if there’s an entry in the knows table where the creator (m.m_creatorid) knows the liker (l.l_personid).Friends of Friends: The second SELECT checks if the liker is a friend of a friend. This is done by joining the knows table twice:First, we find the creator's direct friends (via k1.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid).Then, we check if the liker's l.l_personid is a friend of any of the creator’s friends (via k2.k_person2id = l.l_personid).
- Direct Friends: The first SELECT inside the NOT EXISTS clause checks if the liker (l.l_personid) is a direct friend of the message creator. This is done by checking if there’s an entry in the knows table where the creator (m.m_creatorid) knows the liker (l.l_personid).
- Friends of Friends: The second SELECT checks if the liker is a friend of a friend. This is done by joining the knows table twice:First, we find the creator's direct friends (via k1.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid).Then, we check if the liker's l.l_personid is a friend of any of the creator’s friends (via k2.k_person2id = l.l_personid).
- First, we find the creator's direct friends (via k1.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid).
- Then, we check if the liker's l.l_personid is a friend of any of the creator’s friends (via k2.k_person2id = l.l_personid).
- MessageRatios CTE:This CTE calculates the foreign likes ratio and filters messages where at least half of the likes are foreign.The ratio of foreign likes to total likes is computed as foreign_likes / total_likes, and only messages with a sufficient number of foreign likes are kept.
- This CTE calculates the foreign likes ratio and filters messages where at least half of the likes are foreign.
- The ratio of foreign likes to total likes is computed as foreign_likes / total_likes, and only messages with a sufficient number of foreign likes are kept.
- Final Select:The final SELECT fetches the message ID (m_messageid), total likes (total_likes), and foreign likes (foreign_likes) for each message.The results are ordered by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.
- The final SELECT fetches the message ID (m_messageid), total likes (total_likes), and foreign likes (foreign_likes) for each message.
- The results are ordered by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.

### Example Scenarios:

- Direct Friend:If user A (creator) is friends with user B, and user B likes the post, user B is considered "known" (not foreign), even though they are not the creator.
- If user A (creator) is friends with user B, and user B likes the post, user B is considered "known" (not foreign), even though they are not the creator.
- Friend of Friend:If user A (creator) is friends with user B, and user B is friends with user C, then user C is also considered "known" to user A, even if user C doesn't directly know user A.
- If user A (creator) is friends with user B, and user B is friends with user C, then user C is also considered "known" to user A, even if user C doesn't directly know user A.
- Foreign Like:If a person likes the post but isn't a direct friend of the creator and isn't a friend of any of the creator's friends, that like is counted as foreign.
- If a person likes the post but isn't a direct friend of the creator and isn't a friend of any of the creator's friends, that like is counted as foreign.

### Performance Considerations:

- Indexes: Ensure there are indexes on the following columns for better performance, especially since we're joining multiple tables and filtering large datasets:likes.l_messageid, likes.l_personidmessage.m_messageid, message.m_creatoridknows.k_person1id, knows.k_person2id
- likes.l_messageid, likes.l_personid
- message.m_messageid, message.m_creatorid
- knows.k_person1id, knows.k_person2id
- Union of Two Queries in NOT EXISTS: The union of two subqueries for checking "friends of friends" could be more expensive depending on the size of the knows table. If performance is an issue, you might consider optimizing it further or using alternative methods (e.g., recursive queries, materialized views) depending on your database system.

This updated query should now correctly handle both direct and "friend of friend" relationships and only consider unidirectional knows relationships.

**Du:**

Please adjust the code to disregard the condition l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid

---

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! To adjust the code so that we disregard the condition l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid, we will no longer exclude the creator of the message from being considered a "foreigner" if they liked their own message. This means that if the creator of the message also likes their own post, it will be counted as a valid like (not considered foreign).

### Key Change:

- Remove the condition: l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid from the CASE statement, so that likes from the creator are no longer excluded from counting towards foreign likes. The query will now count the creator’s likes as part of the total likes and also potentially as foreign likes (if the creator is not a friend or a friend of a friend).

### Adjusted SQL Query:

```sql
WITH FriendAndForeignLikes AS (
    -- Step 1: Calculate total likes and foreign likes for each message
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_likes,
        SUM(CASE 
                WHEN NOT EXISTS (
                         -- Check if the like is from the creator's direct friends or their friends' friends
                         SELECT 1 
                         FROM knows k 
                         WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid 
                               AND k.k_person2id = l.l_personid  -- Direct friend check
                         UNION
                         SELECT 1
                         FROM knows k1
                         JOIN knows k2 ON k1.k_person2id = k2.k_person1id 
                         WHERE k1.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid 
                               AND k2.k_person2id = l.l_personid  -- Friend's friend check
                     ) 
                THEN 1  -- The like is foreign
                ELSE 0 
            END) AS foreign_likes
    FROM likes l
    JOIN message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE m.m_length > 100  -- Filter for messages with length > 100
    GROUP BY l.l_messageid, m.m_creatorid
    HAVING COUNT(l.l_personid) >= 20  -- At least 20 likes
),
MessageRatios AS (
    -- Step 2: Calculate the foreign like ratio
    SELECT 
        m.m_messageid,
        fl.total_likes,
        fl.foreign_likes,
        (fl.foreign_likes * 1.0 / fl.total_likes) AS foreign_like_ratio
    FROM FriendAndForeignLikes fl
    JOIN message m ON fl.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE fl.foreign_likes >= fl.total_likes / 2  -- At least half the likes are foreign
)
-- Step 3: Return the message data, ordered by the foreign like ratio
SELECT 
    m.m_messageid,
    fl.total_likes,
    fl.foreign_likes
FROM MessageRatios fl
ORDER BY fl.foreign_like_ratio DESC;

```

### Explanation of Changes:

- Removed l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid:The condition l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid has been removed from the CASE statement. This means that if the creator likes their own message, their like will be counted towards both the total likes and potentially as a foreign like if they are not considered "known" (i.e., they are neither a direct friend nor a friend of a friend).
- The condition l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid has been removed from the CASE statement. This means that if the creator likes their own message, their like will be counted towards both the total likes and potentially as a foreign like if they are not considered "known" (i.e., they are neither a direct friend nor a friend of a friend).
- Foreign Like Calculation:We now count likes from the creator as valid and potentially foreign. The foreign check (NOT EXISTS subqueries) still works in the same way for other users.
- We now count likes from the creator as valid and potentially foreign. The foreign check (NOT EXISTS subqueries) still works in the same way for other users.

### Key Notes:

- Creator’s Likes: If the creator of the message likes their own post, it will be counted as part of the total likes and, depending on whether the creator is considered a friend or friend-of-friend, it might also be counted as a foreign like. However, since we’re disregarding l.l_personid != m.m_creatorid, it will always be included in the count.
- Performance Considerations: As before, this query joins the likes and knows tables, and using the NOT EXISTS with UNION might affect performance. Indexing likes.l_messageid, likes.l_personid, message.m_messageid, and knows.k_person1id, knows.k_person2id will help improve performance.
- Correctness: This query now ensures that:The creator's own like is counted (if applicable).Friend's friends are considered "known" and not foreign.The foreign like ratio is calculated correctly, disregarding the creator’s own like from being excluded.
- The creator's own like is counted (if applicable).
- Friend's friends are considered "known" and not foreign.
- The foreign like ratio is calculated correctly, disregarding the creator’s own like from being excluded.

This should now meet the requirement you outlined where the creator's own like is considered in the total count, potentially as a foreign like if they aren’t friends or friends of friends.

**Du:**

Adjust MessageRatios and the last SELECT to use fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid.

---

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! To make the adjustments you requested, we will use fl.l_messageid in the MessageRatios CTE and in the final SELECT instead of m.m_messageid. This ensures that we're consistently referring to the message ID from the FriendAndForeignLikes CTE (fl), which already contains the necessary calculated fields for total and foreign likes.

Here's the adjusted query:

### Adjusted SQL Query:

```sql
WITH FriendAndForeignLikes AS (
    -- Step 1: Calculate total likes and foreign likes for each message
    SELECT 
        l.l_messageid,
        COUNT(l.l_personid) AS total_likes,
        SUM(CASE 
                WHEN NOT EXISTS (
                         -- Check if the like is from the creator's direct friends or their friends' friends
                         SELECT 1 
                         FROM knows k 
                         WHERE k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid 
                               AND k.k_person2id = l.l_personid  -- Direct friend check
                         UNION
                         SELECT 1
                         FROM knows k1
                         JOIN knows k2 ON k1.k_person2id = k2.k_person1id 
                         WHERE k1.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid 
                               AND k2.k_person2id = l.l_personid  -- Friend's friend check
                     ) 
                THEN 1  -- The like is foreign
                ELSE 0 
            END) AS foreign_likes
    FROM likes l
    JOIN message m ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE m.m_length > 100  -- Filter for messages with length > 100
    GROUP BY l.l_messageid, m.m_creatorid
    HAVING COUNT(l.l_personid) >= 20  -- At least 20 likes
),
MessageRatios AS (
    -- Step 2: Calculate the foreign like ratio
    SELECT 
        fl.l_messageid,  -- Use fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid
        fl.total_likes,
        fl.foreign_likes,
        (fl.foreign_likes * 1.0 / fl.total_likes) AS foreign_like_ratio
    FROM FriendAndForeignLikes fl
    WHERE fl.foreign_likes >= fl.total_likes / 2  -- At least half the likes are foreign
)
-- Step 3: Return the message data, ordered by the foreign like ratio
SELECT 
    fl.l_messageid,  -- Use fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid
    fl.total_likes,
    fl.foreign_likes
FROM MessageRatios fl
ORDER BY fl.foreign_like_ratio DESC;

```

### Explanation of Changes:

- In MessageRatios CTE:We are now using fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid. Since fl comes from the FriendAndForeignLikes CTE, it contains the l_messageid field, which is the message ID for each like.
- We are now using fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid. Since fl comes from the FriendAndForeignLikes CTE, it contains the l_messageid field, which is the message ID for each like.
- In the Final SELECT:In the final SELECT clause, we also use fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid. This ensures that we are consistently working with the message ID from the FriendAndForeignLikes CTE, which has already been processed and contains the total and foreign likes for each message.
- In the final SELECT clause, we also use fl.l_messageid instead of m.m_messageid. This ensures that we are consistently working with the message ID from the FriendAndForeignLikes CTE, which has already been processed and contains the total and foreign likes for each message.

### Summary of Key Points:

- fl.l_messageid: Since we're using fl (the alias for FriendAndForeignLikes), the message ID is referred to as fl.l_messageid in both the CTE and final result.
- Correct Calculation of Foreign Likes: The logic for calculating foreign likes (including creator's own likes, friends, and friends of friends) remains unchanged.

This change ensures consistency in the use of fl.l_messageid throughout the query.
