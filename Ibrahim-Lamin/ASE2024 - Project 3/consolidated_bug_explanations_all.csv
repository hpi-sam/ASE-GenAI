HIT01_8,"The bug occurs due to an illegal argument exception thrown at line 279 when a negative value for minutes (within the acceptable range of -1 to -59 as per version 2.3) is input. This happens because the validation logic incorrectly restricts negative values, despite the updated specifications allowing them. To fix this, update the validation logic at line 279 to permit negative minute values within the range of -1 to -59.",44.95,0.82220995,2
HIT02_24,"The bug occurs when a negative value (-0.5) is passed to the variable `g`, which is expected to be within the range of 0-255. The negative result likely stems from a calculation that does not properly handle or constrain the input values within the specified bounds. To resolve, ensure that any input or calculated value for `g` is clamped to the range [0, 255] by adding boundary checks or constraints in the calculation logic.",52.7,0.7546648,2
HIT03_6,"The bug occurs due to an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when attempting to access an index (`pos`) in a string that exceeds its length, which happens because the calculation or assignment of `pos` does not properly account for the string's actual length. To fix this, update the logic that sets the value of `pos` to ensure it never exceeds the length of the string minus one, thus keeping the index within valid bounds.",44.41,0.7966523,4
HIT04_7,"The bug causes an `AssertionFailedError` in the `updateBounds` method due to incorrect initialization of `maxMiddleIndex` and improper configuration of `this.data`, leading to incorrect period end time calculations. The issue is exacerbated by a missing 'else' clause at line 304, which allows the use of values from previous iterations. To resolve, correctly initialize `maxMiddleIndex` with the `maxMiddle` value, ensure `this.data` is properly set, and update all `getDataItem` calls to use the accurate `maxMiddleIndex`. Additionally, correct the argument in the `getDataItem` call at line 301 to use `this.maxMiddleIndex` and adjust the value in the test's `s.add` method from 3.0 to 1.0.",43.39,0.7907293,93
HIT05_35,"The bug occurs when attempting to cast a null object to an array, which is not permitted and results in a type mismatch, setting the type to `Object` class instead of the expected array type. To resolve this, check if the object is null before casting, and handle the null case appropriately, such as by initializing the array or returning a default value.",47.96,0.73664224,2
HIT06_51,"The bug causes test failures due to an infinite loop in the `addNumber` method, where the variable `x` is improperly initialized and modified, and incorrect string formatting in the `toString` method, which fails to properly format ""-0."" in the fractional part. To resolve, initialize `x` correctly and set appropriate loop termination conditions in `addNumber`, and update the string parsing logic around line 260 to ensure ""-0."" is correctly included in the output. Additionally, check and correct the saved file by adding a space or new line and resaving it to address any file-related issues.",43.93,0.73636013,22
HIT07_33,"The bug is triggered by an exception due to a null dereference on line 910 when processing an array, where the software attempts to use array[i] without first checking for null. This stems from inadequate conditional logic that doesn't properly account for null values. To fix, implement a null check before accessing array[i] and refine the conditional logic to robustly handle all input cases, including null values.",40.38,0.7524784,7
HIT08_54,"The bug occurs due to the strict validation at line 113, which incorrectly rejects locale strings containing underscores (e.g., ""fr__POSIX"") by disallowing underscores in country codes, leading to an exception. The root cause is the validation logic that improperly checks for uppercase letters and fails when encountering an underscore. To fix this, update the validation logic at line 113 to accept underscores and properly handle cases where country codes are absent but extensions are present.",43.93,0.7680954,36
