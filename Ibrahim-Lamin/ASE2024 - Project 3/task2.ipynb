The text is first converted into vector representations using SentenceTransformer embeddings, which capture the meaning of the sentences. Cosine similarity then calculates the angle between these vectors, with a value close to 1 indicating high similarity. A threshold of 0.7 ensures that the merged output remains relevant and aligned with the ground truth."
