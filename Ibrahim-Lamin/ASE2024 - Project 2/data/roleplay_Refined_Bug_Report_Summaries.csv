FailingMethod,Refined Explanation
HIT01_8,"Minutes are set to -15; which is less then 0 and it throws illegal arg exception The code never gets that far. The problem is at line 279 which prevents a negative minutes value being accepted even though the programmer comments indicate that since version 2. 3 negative minutes up to -59 are acceptable. The @throws IllegalArgumentException comment is also referring to versions before 2. 3. In the code there is a check that 0 <= minutes < 60 and the minutesOffset is -15 which does not fall into these prarmeters thus throwing an Exception There is a logical check for if minuteOffset is less than 0 or greater than 59 causing it to throw an exception because the value is out of bounds (negative number)  The issue is on line 279 (as I explained in my first question; of which I misunderstood that I was only being asked about the specific issue; not generalized issue). On line 279 the variable ""minutesOffSet"" is parameterized to throw an exception if it is < 0 or > 59. Line 279 should read ""if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59) {"" because now the method can take in the number of minutes as a negative and will allow the method to properly progress to invoke/call further methods such as those asked about in the two previous questions. The variable ""minutesOffset"" is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279. Any negative value for ""minutesOffset"" will throw this exception; while the documentation states that ""minutesOffset"" can be negative in some cases. Again the issue remains that the parameter check for minutes at line 279 doesn't allow negative numbers  and thus throws the exception. This needs to be changed to allow up to -59 (but only if hour is positive) if the comments are up to date. plus possibly later code as well; but certainly that for starters. This variable contains a value of -15 as set by DateTimeZone. forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15). Line 279 checks to see if is a valid value; meaning that is between 0 and 59. Since it is not; an exception error is thrown in line 280. Yes; the variable gets set to -15 through the arguments above. The code specifically encounters the error on line 279 when it tests if minutesOffset < 0; (-15) which is the case; so it throws the error on line 280 : Minutes out of range: with the value provided for that argument -15. As noted in the comments; valid input for minutes must be in the rage -59 to +59 but on line 279 of the source minutesOffset is checked for < 0. Instead it should be minutesOFfset < -59. Also noted in comments is that versions before 2. 3 minutes had to be zero or positive. ""Minutes out of range: + minutesOffset"" is our error. The second argument should be just 15 The value of minutes offset does not have valid argument as a result this method will not be called as and argument exception will be displayed. yep; they are checking if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception; and as -15 <0; it gets thrown. looks like they updated the comments but not the code. and this is why comments are evil liars that can't be trusted! The error is stemming from line 279 because the value of -15 for minutesOffset is < 0. There should be no issue with the variable minutesOffset; as it was declared properly and should not be related to the failure when it was being used in the correct manner. minutesOffset is of type int; but it is not being miscalled anywhere in the source code. I believe the issue is with hoursOffset not minutes The minute variable was negative therefore; it threw the exception because it only takes numbers between 0 and 59 for minutes. the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero The argument -15 is less than 0; which causes the if statement conditional on line 279 to pass. This results in the exception on line 280 being thrown. According to the comment block above the method; minutesOffset should be checked for below -59 or above 59. There may be an issue as it involves not indigenous java According to the comments; the minute value should be between -59 and +59; but the conditional statement is checking for a value between 0 and 59. There is not an issue with this portion of the code; in fact this is where the exception we receive is thrown. Therefore the issue probably occurs before we reach this part of the code; such as when the arguments are passed into the method. Yes; this line is exactly the one that produces the exception when minutesOffset is <0. As minutesOffset; being the second argument in the function; gets the value -15 in the call to DateTimeZone. forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15) You are passing it a negative offset value (-15) and the conditionals are set to reject any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59 and throw a new exception. the code is incomplete. it properly checks for greater than 59 but neglects to take into account if the hours are negative before rejecting minutes for being negative. it would be more correct though not completely to check for less than -59 instead of less than 0 It will return the offset am not good in thus questanaire Line 279 written as ""minutesOffset < 0"" makes it clear it's the one throwing the Exception; as the -15 in the minutes spot is clearly less than 0. this cause assumes all negative minutes are bad. from the comment; negative minutes are ok when the hours are negative too. the comments specifically say its bad when the mins are negative but the hours are positive. there is a line break in the middle of that part of the comment which could lead a programmer to miss half of the info. Yes ; this conditional clause is exactly the place from where the exception is thrown ; because it is not in valid range of ""minutes"" It's because of second line negative value. This conditional will reject any negative minute input; even if the hour input is also negative. This is the argument exception thrown. -15 is less then 0; so it throws IllegalArgumentException Value passed in minutes -15;where as it checks (<0 | >53). DateTimeZone. forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15) is an invalid argument so it will directly throw an exception. Hence there is no issue between the conditional statement."
HIT02_24,"It's not clear if the program was meant to accept a negative number. I can't answer the question without seeing the definition of this. lowerBound and this. upperBound. g has to be 0-255. But you are passing in -0. 5. I don't know the specifics of the lowerbound and upperbound on the min and max as I am not a Java class expert; but I reckon g comes out negative once the calculation plays out. This does not appear to be an issue because a double is the default data type for decimals so this shouldn't be what is causing the error. The color is out of the parameter should be between 0. 0 and 1. 0 depending on the upperBound and lowerBound values; ""g"" might exceed -255 or 255 which is not a valid value for the Color object. value is a double and is used as a double in the method. Both Math. max() and Math. min() use and return a double. The variable ""value"" is incorrectly used on line 117; where the variable ""v"" should be used in its place. The variable ""value"" can exist beyond the range of ""this. lowerBound"" and ""this. upperBound"" and is causing this error. there is an issue with colors in that programme  It's hard to give an answer based on this small amount of code for me. Generally I have to look at the larger code overall to see what's going on. value really only has to be an int since valid values are forced 0 to 255 later. I imagine it is a double for consistency with other color schemes used in other methods that may use the full range. Nothing in this method checks that the lower range of value is positive -- therefore a negative number is not sanitized. Therefore; the value being -0. 5 in this case results in a negative integer value; which is outside the expected 0 to 255 range for a color. There is a problem with the argument  public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. You are calling the Color constructor with three float parameters so the values are allowed to be between 0. 0 and 1. 0. v is guaranteed to be between the lower and Upper; but Value is not. Should be using v instead of value in line 117 The exception is coming from Color; so it must be g that has a bad value. I need to see the definition of this. lowerBound and this. upperBound to know what is wrong though. The calculation of g appears to result in a negative integer value if the parameter value is negative to begin with. Passing a negative g into Color would produce the error and there is nothing in the definition of g that seeks to prevent that. And the calculation certainly looks like it would come out negative in that scenario. Again without understanding the relevance of lowerbound and upperbound; I cannot be 100 percent certain; as a caveat. should be a float number variable ""g"" might be outside the range of the Color class acceptable range values. g is the cast value of lb \ up - lb *255. As long as the input ""value"" and the lowerBound and upperBound values are correct g will be a int between 0 and 255 and work with Color(int; int; int). While the variable ""g"" may be out of range when passed to the Color constructor; it is being used correctly in this context. The problem is the use of the variable ""value"" which is used to assign a value to ""g"". I can only guess at the upper and lowerBound variables. the code doesn't seem to care if the value passed is negative though otherwise it appears to be trying to force g in the range of 0 to 255 as an int. that might be a problem no Since the exception seems to be thrown up by Color constructor (seeing message - color parameter outside of expected range); there is a problem with the value of g. it is not related to the failure g is an integer; which is acceptable when creating a new Color object; as the arguments require integers. public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. Methods inherited from class java. lang. Throwable  getCause; getLocalizedMessage; getMessage; initCause; printStackTrace; printStackTrace; printStackTrace; toString   It looks like the variable ""g"" is being properly instantiated and the value it is being set to is being cast into an int. no there is no issue. FFFFFFFFFFFDS FFFFFFFFFFFFF yes. should be computed using v; not value."
HIT03_6,"There is no reference to the variable 'pos' in the Exception. and the Exception type is not the same as above. pos will always be less than length; so the code should run. The issue is not in the pos variable; but in the len which tells the pos how far to go the variable ""pos"" holds an integer value while the error deals with a call for the 3rd character in a String that only has 2 characters. The input ""\uD83D\uDE30"" needs to be passed through the Class StringEscapeUtils as well. You are simply initializing pos to be equal to 0 The instantiation of the integer value pos is not at issue if pos is null and len is greater than null then there will be a result. no mistake with that variable pos in the source code I don't see where this calls a method named translate. I haven't used escapeCsv() before. A quick look at the online documentation says ""Returns a String value for a CSV column enclosed in double quotes; if required. "". Hmm. I looked at the source code for escapeCsv() and it calls ESCAPE_CSV. translate(). That isn't this translate tho. And besides that; the string doesn't contain excess commas or quote symbols or newlines. I looked up the two characters and neither appears to be a comma or quote or newline. They both showed up as an unknown character. Ok I get it; it is an issue with index numbers being less than the length  That line simply starts pos out at 0. If there's an issue with pos I don't think it's there as I can't think of any other starting point it should be started at. Checking a character in the string with pos most likely causes an error since the error is a string out of bounds On line 85; a recursive call is made to the function with an improper number of arguments and expecting a return value. This looks correct. The position variable should start at the first character; index 0. There's no issue with the pos variable on the error. The index out of bound error is caused by an index identifier that doesnt exist. For example it tries to read or get the 4th character in the word ""Few"". when the value is reach out of the len value the exception appear  Related 'pos' there won't be any issue;'pos' is an index to write char sequence to writer. have not come across the data type; pos. I'm not sure exactly what is going on given the example code provided; but nothing in the block throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Could not find the solution The while loop has a potential to be infinite if the array c is null (I believe Java allows arrays of size 0). I'm a little fuzzy on what is going on with this code because I'm not up on all the details of handling unicode but the purpose of this sections seems to be dealing with the fact that in things like UTF-8 sometimes you get characters that are one byte and sometimes 2. Anyway; the issue seems to be with the for loop on line 94. We are incrementing the variable pt and checking that it is less than consumed but we are accessing the input via the pos variable. If consumed == 0 on line 86 then we increment pos on line 89. Pos appears to always be incremented at a value of greater than or equal to one for every character in the input. The point is that pos gets incremented at a rate faster than characters from the input are consumed and can become longer than the input length which will raise an error on line 95 when consumed is greater than zero. The only place in the code where they are using arrays and dealing with array indexes; high probability of issue being present here I don't have idea  The function is not called there. lines 84-97 reference character counts; which seems much more correlated to the concept in the failure of being out of range. It almost seems like the amount should be 0 and that is causing the error. I cannot find an issue; but I am not sure Calling the translate method with in it's body. This code is probably the cause of the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error. The String index out of range 2 message seem to indicate that the variable pos is going beyond the size of variable input. On each iteration through the loop; pos is being incremented but it could already be at the end of input; so after it is incremented again; pos is going to be invalid; causing a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error. On line 95; there is a space between pos and += which I feel is the wrong syntax. Instead; it should be pos+=. I suspect this threw an exception. Yes I dont know because some of the values are not given in this function code sometimes may that can lead to a run time bug. According to the syntax; there is no issue; but need to check with any  an illegal arguments from the complete program pt can go out of range of the array I can't see an obvious problem Possibly. If ""pos"" somehow exceeded the length of the input string; I suspect that line 87 would throw the OutOfBounds exception; probably during the call to Character. codePointAt(). The error has to be in this block. It's possible that pos is getting increased too much at line 95 also and the error is occurring at that line. This is definitely where the problem is; but I'm not sure where. The exception isn't being thrown by the source code below so it is occurring within a function that is being called in it. It is possible the codePointAt function is causing the error; but I'm not sure. This appears to be an incremental loop that doesn't have any errors in it. I don't see what would be in here that would say something is out of range. While I am not sure exactly what this portion of the program is trying to accomplish I believe that there is a high likelihood that it could cause the program to crash. My thoughts are that on line 95 we are incrementing pos by a value associated with input; and then we are repeating this while an unrelated condition (pt < consumed) holds true. I think there is a strong possibility this would cause us to step out of bounds on input and get the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException we see in the error. It doesn't look like there's any indexing going on there. There is no code to prevent pt++ from exceeding len (where len = input. length();) pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range. The test doesn't use the related source code. Unless translate is called within another function that isnt provided there is no guaranteed way of knowing whether it is the source of failure or not. I think this is a valid for loop; I am not very sure what line 95 is saying though. Therefore I must conclude that the for-loop between lines 94 and 96 is not causing the failure. It might if the position it returns in the string isn't accessible the for loop is limited up to the value of consumed; while pos is incremented; possibly past the end of input since there are no check conditions. This could be the cause of the exception. 'pos' is continually incremented and used to point to a point in 'input'; without validating it is still in range it possibly is pointing past the length of the string This for loop will terminate properly; but it is unclear whether or not the ""pos"" variable will have a valid value by the end of the loop. However; it is unlikely that this should cause the error. Gotcha; I can number the lines now. There is nothing wrong with the for loop. The number of characters translated should be properly accounted for by codePointAt; so pos should be incremented accordingly for normal and unicode characters. Not an expert but it would throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException rather than StringIndexOutOfBoundsException I would have thought; though the codePointAt is array processing. If the error is thrown here I would suspect it is due to line 89. (just copied my last statement since it applies here as well); StringEscapeUtils is a java constructor with the method escapeCsv; translate isn't even being used at all in the assertion. PT++ Should be PT+ The Int pt variable value is reach out of the consumed the exception accoutered. the string IndexOutOfBoundsException when the index value reach out of length it appear. If the codePointAt method returns a unicode character value greater than 0x10000; then charCount returns 2; which would be potentially added to pos to create a larger index value than the string length. The invocation will call to inspect the input at positions that are out of range (pos) The pos counter is being incremented in line 89 and line 95 within the while; so it could be incremented beyond the len variable. This could throw the exception if pos exceeds len. I am not sure how such a state would be reached. This method is not related to assertequals or stringescapeutils at all so it has no bearing; the issue will still be the Unicode escapes. I just don't see it. I don't notice anything. It seems like a simple increment on the pos variable. Think So That variable is not correct I don't believe it is even reaching that section of code; I believe the error to be somewhere in the while loop. That for loop is just changing the pos variable after a successful run. Yes; there is an exception with surrogate pairs; so there is an issue in line 95 which deals with surrogate pairs I think. Don't understand Unicode and UTF-16 handling well enough to pinpoint the problem. depending on the input; the ""pos"" could be longer than the length of the input. Syntax is correct; it does not lead to string index out of range failure charCount;codePointAt determines the number of char values needed to represent the specified character. Why is this recursive? Unnecessarily complicated. I wouldn't bother debugging; just recode it. A very poor use of recursion. as pos gets larger; it will go past CharSequence at given (input; pos) As I said in my previous answer; I'm pretty sure the issue is with one of the Character. codePointAt method calls. It also would require the ""pos"" variable to reach the value of 2 to have thrown the error listed above. I can't figure out any way for the ""pos"" variable to reach a value of 2 and still execute another iteration of the loop (which might lead to the execution of line 87 and an exception there). Each time the ""pos"" variable is changed (potentially to an invalid amount) the continue keyword sends the program back to line 84 where the ""pos"" value is checked against the ""len"" variable for validity. Therefore; it seems that the only place where the exception could be coming from is line 95. I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions; the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds. Error is in line in lines 85-88."
HIT04_7,"The tested code only adds one TimePeriod to the TimePeriodValues instance and therefore updateBounds is only called once at that point. When called all of the index properties have been initialized to -1 and so therefore the else component of the referenced conditional is executed and the maxMiddleIndex should be correctly set to the input index. In the initialization of e and s; the parameters for getDataItem is this. minMiddleIndex. It should be this. maxMiddleIndex division with 0 does not work this. maxMiddleIndex = index <--- In lines 305 AND 309 this part of the code is used. Honestly; I've only debugged fairly short code before. I guess; VERY short code--and because I was writing it; it was even easier to debug. No issues that I can see I dont think anything unusual here the if conditions and the functions are in correct semantic manner. This method doesn't have issues related the failure to find a max middle index As far as I can tell there shouldn't be an issue but that section is the only section in the code shown that deals with MaxMiddleIndex which is what the failure is caused by. There are errors throughout this code. public void add(TimePeriodValue item) wont get invoked since it takes only one argument whereas the test s. add(new SimpleTimePeriod(0L; 50L); 3. 0) has two arguments here; so it means issue is somewhere else. TimePeriodValues s = new TimePeriodValues(""Test""); Simple implication being performed here. No issues from what I see. The issue is before these lines as it does not have the correct assumption for the middle index line number 299-302 should be like below :     long s = getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getStart(). getTime();              long e = getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getEnd(). getTime(); I do not see a viable issue right away. There do not appear to be errors with the clause. this. data. size() seems to be 4. The code may be the reason for the failure. when reach the index low then 0 then the code will not be able to executed it expected one arg but it give the greater values  There very well could be an issue in this variable definition; although I am not sure specifically what it would be. There are  number of chained method calls here that would need to be examined in more detail in order to really determine if this is the cause of the failure. There might be an error that makes the MaxMiddleIndex take the value of the index and cause the assertion failure. s. add method expects one parameter of type timeperiod - in the test; the s. add method is called with two parameters. long maxMiddle = s + (e - s) / 2;              if (middle > maxMiddle) {                  this. maxMiddleIndex = index;    While by convention you should use easy to read names; the variable is being declared in conditional clauses that will not run at the same time. i think; instead of 3. 0; we need to put 1. 0 You initialise count to 0; then you never change that value. You assert that it is expected to be 1. The method is behaving correctly. middle index is returned from this part of the code I am not sure. No clue; only thing I can think is to throw new. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getStart(). getTime() no ideas The definition of the variable had nothing to do with the error. on the initialization; that section of code should not be entered as  this. maxMiddleIndex is still -1   in addition s is declared the same as that which should be returned in that declaration at  s = getDataItem(). Plus; I don't see where there could be a try. catch block that could throw the AssertionFailedError. It could be something in the ""getDataItem"" method or one of the subsequent stacked method calls that are after it. There is truly not enough code to make a decision. I'm going to assume TimePeriodValues have a constructor that takes a String and first line is okay. However; I don't see an add method in TimePeriodValues that take a SimpleTimePeriod and a double. I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues. add(SimpleTimePeriod; double). Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception. Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues. add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int. There seems to be a few type mismatch issues in the code above and below. Also; I feel like I'm missing additional code if the output above is returned. Maybe because you have a global variable 's' and a local variable 's' but I looked it and Java supports 'variable shadowing' so I really don't know. I do not know what is causing this failure. I see no issue with the variable ""s"" in the code below and I cannot re-create the failure. I'm not this familiar with java Presumably the recalculate method is called during initialization or at the very least the indexes are set to -1 at initialization. However; the may not be and that could be the issue. Also; presumably this. data is empty after initialization. If this. data is empty than updateBounds will be called with an index of 0. The highlighted code doesn't even get executed if maxMiddleIndex = -1 as I expect. If for some reason maxMiddleIndex is >= 0 such that line 299 gets executed that line doesn't set or change maxMiddleIndex. The entire code block containing line 299 at best sets maxMiddleIndex to index which equals 0. For the code to produce the results it does it would seem that maxMiddleIndex has to start with a value >= 0 and/or this. data has to start in a non-empty state such that the index passed into updateBounds is not 0. I beleive the getTime will cause a problem; because you are trying to set s to be variable of type ""long""; and getTime is going to return a time value. The function getMaxMiddleIndex() seems to be the problem and I don't see it in this code. The failure is caused by the fact that an assertion test was set to 1 on an index fetch on the one time period added to the TimePeriodValues. The index is set to 3; so any index range get function will return 3 at this point corresponding to that one time period's index; which will fail an assertion test looking for a 1. The function in line 299 won't play into this at all. we are doing assertEquals(1; s. getMaxMiddleIndex()); which should give us an AssertionFailedError  if we did assertEquals(3; s. getMaxMiddleIndex()); than it would work At line 299; variable ""s"" is declared which contributes to setting ""maxMiddleIndex"" The method call on line 299 and on line 301 are being invocated on the wrong object. The object should be ""this. maxMiddleIndex"" instead of ""this. minMiddleIndex"". There would be an issue cause the function add uses the updatebound with different var type I really can't find the problem with the incovation. I am sorry. Not aware of this error I cannot see the getPeriod(); getStart(); or getTime() methods. It's possible that there is an issue with this line; because it's directly related to calculating the maxMiddleIndex value; but without looking into those methods; there is no way to tell. You're initializing assertEquals to believe the count will be one; while the actual count is three. You need to change the 1 to a 3 on assertEquals. NO COMMENTS it is very easy to execute the code and get the output In the code; in the previous if; you are checking whether maxIndex is greater than 0; but then using MinIndex(L 298). You should check; before calling that code; whether it's within index. parameter for s is already set for 3 but expected value 1 so there is an issue i dont know how I am expected to know the outcome of this program without the code for the function getmaxmiddleindex At line 299; it should be ""getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex)"" instead of ""getDataItem(this. minMiddleIndex)"". As the code is currently written; it compares a possible new maxMiddle against the current minMiddle; when it should be comparing against the maxMiddle on that line and the next line (299 and 300). low version jdk not support line 299 should be:      long s = getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getStart(). getTime();    and line 300 should also be corrected; otherwise there will be another assertion failure:      long e = getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getEnd(). getTime(); e is of type Long; which matches what is needed or can be cast appropriately. I don't see why it would cause the error. I am not familiar enough with some of the functions used to know if there is an issue. When we are calculating maxMiddleIndex the value to be considered should be   long e = getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getEnd(). getTime();  instead  long e = getDataItem(this. minMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getEnd(). getTime();  is used. I think changing this value to maxMiddleIndex should work as the mean would be calculated properly. The variable e is used in two locations which are both reachable by the program (because both minMiddleIndex and maxMiddleIndex are values that can both evaluate to greater than 0) and it can be changed unintentionally. From looking at the source code; perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter. You are passing minMiddleIndex; though we are checking for maxMiddleIndex. Variable is different  variable ""e"" is used as a conditional to determine maxMiddleIndex  I feel the expression in e should be changed. There is nothing wrong with the declaration or assignment of this variable. Seems like the right way to do it; but I may not have enough context. I can't figure out how to calculate the s. getMaxMiddleIndex(). You would presumably want the end to refer to maxMiddleIndex. long e = getDataItem(this. maxMiddleIndex). getPeriod(). getEnd(). getTime(); it not contion in the version of jdk I don't think there should be any issue cause of e for above code I believe that the line should use this. maxMiddleIndex rather than this. minMiddleIndex on line 301. The problem is elsewhere. programming skill e is the time in milliseconds. getDataItem need to return time in milliseconds ;so that it can be accommodated as long value in 'e' variable  Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex. Since the assertion fails when checking the MaxMiddleIndex it is likely there is something wrong with the assessor functions or how the value they return is being manipulated. It doesn't seem like there's an issue with line 301; when line 287 is the exact same thing. It looks more like ""s. add"" in the test portion above should contain the value 1 instead of 3. 0. Difficult to point out There does not seem to be an issue with the getDataItem; getTime; getEnd; get Period; and they seem to be in the correct order for an operation like that to happen Code in and around line 301 contains a bug wherein minMiddleIndex is used instead of maxMiddleIndex; will result in a wrong maxMiddleIndex in general. However; for code example given above; I cannot see any way this bug causes the expects-1-but was-3 assertion failure. There appears to be missing code. I believe it should be dealing with the maxMiddleIndex using minMiddleMindex there. ? whoops! maybe if the variable names were less insane and verbose (and the methods less verbose) then they would more easily catch errors like that. I can not determine any issue with the method invocations on line 301. The code is working in those areas; there are checks inplace to make sure the number is above 0. At line 301 the argument of ""getDataItem"" should be ""this. maxMiddleIndex"" but is instead ""this. minMiddleIndex"". This call is part of a method that updates bounds for all index variables( ""minStartIndex""; ""maxStartIndex""; ""minMiddleIndex""; etc)and more specifically the section of that code that updates the ""maxMiddleIndex"". Information that was retrieved using the ""getTime"" method erroneously retrieved it from the ""minMiddleIndex"" which led to bounds being updated incorrectly. there is no clear invocation of functions The issue is probably at line 304. There is no 'else' part for the 'if' check at 304 which can lead it to use values from previous iterations. This call-chain is consistent with other lines that call the same. My guess would be that there's a problem with one of the methods being called; not the chain itself. i tested and i checked The method invocation looks normal. I see no issues at line 301 that raise any suspicion to me. I'm not familiar with Java. Cannot see the method getMaxMiddleIndex(); so unsure of what is happening. You want to check for maxMiddleIndex to see if its value makes sense with the updated bounds. However; when calculating the maxMiddleIndex; you use this. minMiddleIndex instead of this. maxMiddleIndex as your index for retrieving the period. This should give you the wrong time span. Yes; since the method invocations are part of an expression to get the value for variable e where its result impacts the value to set for the maxMiddleIndex variable. But there should be no issue or error on the usage of the method invocations. The error encountered is just a result of an assertion where the expected result is different from the one being returned."
HIT05_35,"If array is null and element is null it sets type to object class. Same concept here you are trying to cast an object to an array and you are not allowed to do so. That was my first impression; that the use of generics enforces type; and the copyArrayGrow1 method should return an object of type array; or the code will break. However; I could be wrong. No because type is a generic class that can be set to anything. the template ends up with the class being type of string and the result is string[] it should implicit cast to the type of the object returned. I don't think ""type"" is a reserved word in Java. I don't think there's a problem as Class<?> can represent a Class object of any type. I do not know enough about arrays in JAVA to know if the failure is related. The type should be directly inferred from the Template argument types. The array should be made of the type specified; not the getClass() of either the array or the element. I do not believe Class<?> type in line 3288 is responsible for the failure because by writing Class<?>; you are declaring a Class object which can be of any type (? being a wildcard); and the failure is related to an object being casted as a string. However; my reasoning should be taken with a grain of salt since I am still learning Java code myself after transitioning over from C++ and Matlab Yes; as with the previous problems ""type"" gets set to the Object class when both ""array"" and ""element"" are null. Yes; type gets set to Object when both parameters to add are null which is what causes the ClassCastException. type will be object when it should be string We are passing Null values ya it may be the reason but not clearly say the failure accoutered if the data interchange between two differed datatype variables if its not portable  Both the first conditional statment and nested conditional statement are false; therefore the line sets the variable type=Object. class. Since the failure relates to an attempt to cast an object to a string; it seems that this could be where the type object is introduced and therefore may be related to the failure. I think that the array and string being null is likely to cause a problem in this case. The inferred type for the array is Object. However; sa which will be bound to the return value has a type of String[]. As the error message states Java can not cast an Object array to a String array. Not very sure; but the failure involves an object trying to be assigned to a String. No string involved in the line of code 3288 I believe it is the casting at 3290 that is the issue as copyArrayGrow1 returns an object. element != null ? element. getClass() : Object. class  -- the object is null so this is returning an Object type. I believe the error is likely to be somewhere in this line given that the failure is a class cast exception and this is the line where the classes are being retrieved. I'm not confident in which part specifically the issue is though. I see no reason why the line of code in question should lead to an IllegalArgumentException. This line is specifically included to deal with null objects. Both stringArray and aString should be perfectly acceptable formats. No troubles with the conditional; it's doing its job properly; its the casting thats causing the issue. Doesn't seem wrong type will end up being a class object after this example. Other than that; I'm lost. no there is no issue there is no issue It doesn't have any logic to make sure BOTH cases don't fail (and thus one can be null. ) The double ternary operator and the ""type = array != null"" part are very confusing and hard to figure out. the method public static Object[] add(Object[] array; Object element) Copies the given array and adds the given element at the end of the new array. The new array contains the same elements of the input array plus the given element in the last position. The component type of the new array is the same as that of the input array. If the input array is null; a new one element array is returned whose component type is the same as the element; unless the element itself is null; in which case the return type is Object[] ==> so we would end up with java. lang. ClassCastException Ljava. lang. Object; cannot be cast to Ljava. lang. String; As mentioned before; we need to first verify that array parm is not null before using getClass on it so that there will be an instance that allows getClass to work. If it were me; I would write a simple if statement that's easy to understand. The use of the : ? type statement is concise I guess; but when you start nesting them like this you're just begging for trouble; or just showing off in my not so humble opinion. I THINK THIS ANSWERS It is valid nested conditional clause;which getClass() depends on whether array!=null or null. Yes; this is related to the failure (though not where the failure actually occurs). The logic here first checks the array type if it's not null; but because the array is null in our case; it sets ""type"" to a basic Object type. This value gets passed to copyArrayGrowl() which returns a copy of the array. The ""type"" that's set in this line would usually be a backup value in case the array is null; but since the array is both null and the ""type"" value passed is a basic Object type; the array that's returned is an Object[] array; causing the failure later on. There is an issue with this line; but it's because the type variable is set incorrectly on line 3288. newArray is not a reserved name and the copyArrayGrowl method appears to return an Object of type Array; which is the cast to T[] which matches the newArray type. I don't know; as I need the complete program The code is passing the class type as null. There we see if array and element both are null; then it is set to Object. class. Object classes are not implicitly converted to Strings because this can fail if the Object does not convert directly to a String (it could; but maybe not - thus the fail). So; you are expecting an IllegalArgumentException from add; but there is no coding of this. You might try throwing an error instead of using Object. class by default. Something on the lines of:    Class<?> type;  if (array != null) {    type = array. getClass(). getComponentType(); // if it isn't an array class; fail  } else if (element != null) {    type = element. getClass(); // build the collection on this type otherwise  } else {    throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Arguments must not both be null!"");  } There should not be T() before the newArray You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null. No. There is no problem with the definition or the use of definition of variable newArray. The problem lies on the line 19 of the copyArrayGrow1 method source code; where in our case the compiler will create an array of type Object and then return it. We can't cast an array that is created of type Object with no elements of any other type to type T[]. I can see that "" T[] newArray = (T[]) copyArrayGrow1(array; type);"" copies an array and adds the given elements to said array; but I'm unsure with the variable declared above. The variable ""type"" is taken as an argument in declaring ""newArray"" and the variable is cast into type ""T[]"" that the two class variables must not be compatible. I'm honestly rather confused by ""Class<?> type = array != null ? array. getClass() : (element != null ? element. getClass() : Object. class);"" In having an unknown class it seems that the method might not work with multiple unknowns. But I'm rather unsure. Since the inputs are null; then return is an array of [null]. This cannot be cast to a type String. The declaration of newArray fails when it is null as in the example. Cannot establish relationship of ""test"" with the ""source code"" well the generic is recognized to be a String type by the jvm but then the type value is Object ArrayUtils. add() method accepts Object parameters only and not String. So using T type converts your runtime objects to String and not as Objects. So modify the class to use Objects instead of T type for this operation alone. Use a cast check if required; but stick to Objects for this. Alternatively; you can write your own add() method if you want it to accept String readily. No; it appears to be used as intended. The new array being build will have the first array combined with the new element. The second parameter will be the array type. I think this could be answered ""Yes"" or ""No"" legitimately. The locus of the problem seems; to me; to be the choice of using a generic here; and particularly how it was typed in line 3288. So; in that sense one might say that ""No"" there is not a problem. However; this line we are examining in this equation; line 3290; does contain the definition of the variable ""newArray"" which is then able to be assigned the ""offending"" Object type. So in that sense; there IS something wrong here with the use or definition of the variable. Because a new object array is being copied to a string type array some elements of the array could not be cast appropriately. i think new array value going to be null in this program ; it may be a cause of error."
HIT06_51,"All of the conditionals appear to be functioning correctly and don't have a direct association with the method being called in the test. So how can Math functions operate on it? I don't believe so - (long)x will be equal to x for -0. 0. We won't go through the while loop since abs(x) is 0; therefore exp will remain 0. So we will add Long. toString(value); which is Long. toString(0); which should give us ""0"". This seems valid to me. As aforementioned; your flow isn't pushing into this code if I'm not mistaken - where is the parsePrint method here? As for the mantissa calc stuff; that kind of logic always blows me unless I get it running with some numbers and think it out real hard. Where is parsePrint?  The error is in the while loop within the clause which will never be able to exit the loop; for the same reasons I wrote in the first question. Because the error is within the loop; the loop will continue and never reach the end of the method ""addNumber"" and as such the add method will never be called from outside the source code. Could not establish relationship between the ""test"" and the ""source code"" (long)x will cast double to long. However; they might not be equal in many cases when x will have any decimal place. So; if clause may not be true in many cases. Correct the while loop. The problem will be solved. I do not think this clause would cause the failure we see; it is concerned with converting a value to scientific notation; but I do not think it could result in a value of negative 0. I think so there was a syntax error Could not understand the test case but since most of the processing is happening in this code block so it is probable. I am still not sure what could be causing the failure. See previous answer. I don't have experience with toString() either; but I guess it must be where the [] is appearing. I presume this is at line 260 as the exponent would be >2 for a 0; and obvious no ""E"" was printed. The conditional looks good. It is comparing the long of x to x and if they are the same continue; although I am not sure why you would need to compare the long x to x. No code in here calls parsePrint I believe ""E"" within the clause is resulting to the failure. The comparison between (long)x == x could cause an error since x is still a double. However; java should convert the double x to a long. Also; that error would not be the same as the one listed above. The conditional clause identified is not involved in the error being produced. not exactly a problem with that code section but there seems to be an improper parsing of a negative zero fractional portion earlier in the code. this section can only use the value of x it was given. the error suggests ""-0. "" is missing from the comparison. this is understandable if the output of the code section is simply using the value of x as input; that is x = 0. I don't know what the ""add()"" method does for sure; but it seems to only build strings. Looks to me like it should be // if (exp >0) // in order to get the correct output. It is not an issue with the code it is an issue with your saved file and you have to open it up and add a space or line and resave and the problem should go away. a parsePrint method is used on the value to be compared (var x = -0. 0). The parsed value is not necessarily the same as the original value; and thus the ComparisonFailure There are no conditional clause issues. The failure received above relates to a failure in comparison of two string/string objects due to incompatible formats. The failure above is not caused by any part of source code given below. comparison was proper. The if-else block on line 257-261 seems correct. The 'add' function takes a string as an argument; which looks correct. The 'add' function looks ok. although I don't know what 'maybeEndStatement();' does. I think the problem is with the test function itself. the method parsePrint is not invoked as I see from the given code I think so; addbstring converts the null message to the String ""null"" may be I am wrong The highlighted if statement relates to the treatment of large numbers; not decimals. When parsing string ""var x = -0. 0""; exp=0; mantissa=value=0 so it never enters the if condition on line 251. Exp =0 so else condition on line 259 is evaluated. They all had values with successful conversion to string The conditional statement should have no issue since the variable 'exp' is declared and initialized in the same namespace; and is an integer. The method being called in the test is parsePrint; which is not included in the source code nor the functions that are call or are called by the source code listed. Since it is not possible to determine how lines 257-261 are being called; it is not possible to determine whether or not these lines are related to the failure. if pretty print call addNumber with -0. 0 as input exp is 0; add is called with ""0"" string; so doesn't occurs any deletion no issue found Yes there is. Everything should be in the right type. When you are passing the strings to add; everything should come out as one string. Therefore it should still be an int. This is on comparison of two obviously non-null strings; for example assertEquals(""a""; ""b""). The problem is that a [-0. ] is expected; but not returned. The call to add passes as an argument the string of value that could not be possibly be [-0] as it formerly was a long number; which has no sign on 0. This is the place where the -0. expected might be loss. This could be the problem but I suspect the issue is either on line 248 or 263. I suspect java has representations for both -0. 0 and 0. 0 for floating point numbers but not integers. The code on line 260 may not even get execute because the block starting at line 247 may never be entered. After the explicit conversion to a long and then the implicit conversion back to a double for the comparison I think you may end up with the test 0. 0 == -0. 0 we I imagine would evaluate to false. If this is the case then line 263 gets executed and I suspect String. valueOf(x) is converting -0. 0 to 0. If the code block on line 247 is entered then I suspect the issue is line 248. I believe longs only have one representation for zero so the cast converts -0. 0 to 0. There is a small chance that longs have a -0 value in which case the issue could be with line 260 but I don't think that is the case. toString can be added. Yes. The problem is exactly that when we get to line 260 in our code (add(Long. toString(value));); we actually send 0 as an argument to the ""add"" method; not -0. 0 portion of the number and automatically converting the remaining -0 to 0; since it's the same thing to the compiler. As a result; 0 is appended to our string; not -0. 0. No issues I don't really understand what is going at this part of the code. to string returns string in exponential notation format. value would be a long; which does not have a decimal place; that is what was happening in the error. There was only 0; no decimal; meaning that x was either not a float; or double; or it was being floored; or ceilinged just be fore the end. It's possible that there could be an issue there; depending on the value of ""value""; but chances are the issue with that line would actually come into play at line 248; instead of line 260. It is valid. add method just converts the String to Long and adds the specified value. i now see what the add method at the bottom. sorry for the last response. For the last question; i now don't believe there was an error related to the failure because running add("" ""); will assign a blank space to a char; which will successfully be returned by the getlastchar function as "" "" and be appended to whatever the append function does. For this question; I don't believe there is an issue either. The value of value will be assigned just as well as to a char as the value of "" "" line 260 is not changing the value of x and thus is not related to the failure of x not being the expected value I believe that the problem must be in the add method. I do not see the problem in the code that is shown. I think the problem might be in the maybeEndStatement method. value is properly converted to a string before being passed into the function. I doubt this line is relevant either. It merely adds a number to the string if that number is multiplied by ten with an exponent less than two. That should have nothing to do with the differences between the two strings listed in the failure. Neither is off by a great deal; nor do they seemingly have an odd value thrown in. the exp variable not get the value is unusable function so the code not executed allways."
HIT07_33,"It checks for NULL first; if it's not null then it's either empty or populated. Presumably; in order to run the code it has to compile and to compile it has to type check. There shouldn't be a problem with this declaration. The error is likely because of input to the class but not directly caused by the variable definition (and would probably run correctly with other inputs). On line 910; there is no check for whether array[i] is null before array[i] is dereferenced; the second member of the test input array is null; causing the exception to be thrown. the template isn't expecting a null pointer - but that's what is being passed in!  The error seems to be dependent on what is passed into the function and not the definition of the variable ""array"" It looks like array is being properly declared as a variable here and that shouldn't be causing a problem. To me; it seems as if the array variable here is not the problem as the values and methods it's using and dealing with are seemingly valid - but I'm not sure where else in your code the exception is except that the parameters you're passing to these two assert parameter array initializations would be the likely suspect. I was wondering if this toClass method is an overload of the ClassUtils method toClass since you're using the ClassUtils object as the second parameter of your assert here. I do not believe there is any issue with how array is used but I am not sure. Declared and used properly. All this section is doing is that it is passing in the array that is given during runtime - the error does not occur here. the method public static Class<?>[] toClass(Object. array) Converts an array of Object in to an array of Class objects. If any of these objects is null; a null element will be inserted into the array. This method returns null for a null input array. Now the method; public static boolean equals(Object[] a;Object[] a2) Returns true if the two specified arrays of Objects are equal to one another. The two arrays are considered equal if both arrays contain the same number of elements; and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two arrays are equal. Two objects e1 and e2 are considered equal if (e1==null ? e2==null : e1. equals(e2)). In other words; the two arrays are equal if they contain the same elements in the same order. Also; two array references are considered equal if both are null. and we have null inserted into the arrays to be compared ==> java. lang. NullPointerException An object is being passed as an array as a parameter in toClass; so this shouldn't cause the exception. Again; I think it's okay if you add the conditional check in I referred to in the previous 2 answers. But I'm certainly not positive. []array should be [array] NO it is not reason to the failure the it can able to store any type of data's in java. object is a common type to hole data s  I think when it gets to array[i] when I is 1. It references null   So calling getClass() on null will give null pointer exception The second element of our input array is null. When we call the getClass method on null a NullPointerException is raised. However; the code contained within the for loop on line 910 may be causing the problem; because it may not handle the case where array[i] is null. The for-loop dereferences members of the array without first checking whether they're null (this is the issue I was referring to before; though it's not technically with the variable ""array. "") The for-loop looks correct; it doesn't seem to be the cause. the getClass() method cannot read from null! I want to say the error of the NullPointerException is caused by these lines of code; as this is where you finally call on the array object; after checking to see if the object itself is null or empty. I'm not sure if the. This could potentially be causing a null exception. I don't believe there is an issue. These lines are just a recursion until the end of the array. putting classes into a class array; no error there While it seems like a perfectly reasonable for-loop that walks through the passed array and adds it to the class array; I suspect it is the problem with how Objects are technically handled through Java. I believe index 1 in the array being looped through is a null; so this would cause an exception since getClass expects an object; not null. i++ should be i+ yes the classes is the set type and the array is the object type so the type conversion is not possible it the reason for the failure the loop seems to me ok as per my understanding  There will not be any failure; Iterating set of classes and returning set of classes. we can print the value array[i]. getClass() to know set of classes. Yes because the line is trying to get the class of a null object. The getClass method is being used correctly and the array is populated with Objects. I think that getClass could produce a null pointer error if it were applied to a null; however; I don't see how that would work with this code. It seems that toClass() only acts on {""Test"";null;99d}; which is not null (though it contains a null). That said; I may be misremembering the hierarchy of class/object in Java; so I'm very uncertain on this. (Ie; perhaps toClass() throws an error when it's not in the right place of the hierarchy -- although a null pointer exception would still be hard to explain. ) Not sure if it's possible; but it could be because you're trying to do get class on null at array position 1. there does not seem to be a problem. getClass() may be written wrong though There should be some code that says that if array[i] == null; to not attempt to getClass() and just class[i] = null; Everything seems ok a null check should be included here. Check if array[i] is null. Check its not null then execute line 910. input for the method is passed with null;     new Class[]{String. class; null; Double. class}; ClassUtils. toClass(new Object[]{""Test"";null;99d} It is trying to grab the intValue within the program but because there is not one you get the Exception. As we iterate through Object's dimensions; there are null arrays in the middle. getClass doesn't work on nulls and throws a NullPointerException. You might try testing for these nulls at line 910 like so:    classes[i] = array[i] == null ? null : array[i]. getClass(); The FOR loop should check if the element (array[i]) is null. If yes; then set classes[i] to null. Else; assign classes[i] to the return of getClass(). Is the code not create an array of objects named ""Class""? Why invite confusion since you're not creating a new class; but objects named Class. It would be better to name them ClassLikeObjects or something. The second element of the array is null (which has no class); and the getClass method with produce a NullPointerException in this case. there is no issue in the getClass line in the source code It may be that the getClass at line 910 is attempting to access a null value as if it was not null. Perhaps line 903 may be the source of the error. If the getClass method is using information from the public static Class; it may be interpreting the value incorrectly. usage of array variable doesnot leads to null pointer exception Yes; I think that the NullPointerException is thrown when. getClass is called on the null listing in the middle of the arrays. Trying to get the class of a null object will throw a nullpointexception the method public static Class<?>[] toClass(Object. array) Converts an array of Object in to an array of Class objects. If any of these objects is null; a null element will be inserted into the array. This method returns null for a null input array.

HIT08_54,"The country code is missing. Or rather lines 115/117 are looking at '_P' and the underscore fails the validation. in line 115; if (ch3 > 'A' || ch3 < 'Z' || ch4 >'A' || ch4 < 'Z') Again as the last question; the input is in the wrong format and therefore the program correctly throws an error We still have the problem from line 115 with ch3 not being a-z; but if that weren't the problem; then line 121-122 would cause the failure as well. Ch5 isn't an underscore. THERE IS code condition at 110 is throwing exception. if (str. charAt(2) != '_') {                  throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid locale format: "" + str);              } Line 115 invalid case. Given that the format of the locale appears to be cc__CCCCC (c for character); the third character of the locale will always contain an underscore. Which in ASCII has a greater value than 'Z' causing the ""ch3 > 'Z'"" portion of the if statement on line 115 to be true and throw the exception. The issue seems to be in the formatting of the input; it must be separated by an underscore and be the correct length. The failure occurs during the execution of lines 115 - 116. In line 113; ch3 is set to be ""_"". In the if statement of line 115; ch3 is checked for being less than 'A'; which is false; but it is also checked for being greater than 'Z'; and it turns out that the value for '_' is greater than 'Z'. Since this is so; this particular if statement executes; and throws out the failure outlined above. In this example; the exception is still thrown based on the conditional statement at line 115. However; there would also be an issue with line 121. Since the string is greater than 5 characters; and the fifth character is not the expected underscore(""_""); this would also throw an exception. The str variable must be the correct length and start with two lowercase letters; which can be followed by an underscore; two uppercase letters; another underscore; and three lowercase letters. Lines 107 to 126 are validating this with if statements. If the str variable does not meet this criteria; an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. The str varible with a value of fr__POSIX seems to be valid up until line 121 where the if statement checks to see if the 6th character in str in an underscore. Since it is not; an IllegalArgumentException error is thrown with the message Invalid locale format:fr__POSIX this is the same problem as last time. line 115 is not going to like the 4th character being an underscore. The output result is Language code in lowercase and Countrycode in Uppercase in between separator use underscore. else statement is missing None;this is an expected behavior on the code. This only means that the condition that will determine if the format of the locale value is met throwing the IllegalArgumentExeption error (Invalid locale format). This is because either the 3rd of 4th character in the local value must be an alpha character where the 3rd char is (_) satisfying the condition to throw the error. they should have specified for each length specifically. Not an issue. GIGO. garbage in; garbage out. The method says it validates strictly. See previous discussion. Yes. Since the length of the string is not 2; it would proceed to the else block. Within that; it would pass the first if statement without issues but would throw an exception after the second if statement; where ch3 and ch4 are checked. The issue would arise not because of ch4; which would pass (be true); but rather ch3 which it expects to be a capital letter and it is an underscore in the string passed. The exception we receive would be thrown at line 116. The input 'fr__POSIX' is not following the expected format outlined in the javadoc: the fourth character is part of the country code and ""must be uppercase"" (not an underscore) ch3 is assigned a ""_"" value. This value throws a failure in line 115; as it is not a letter between A and Z. ch3; ch4 checks if the country code are in capital letters or not. I don't think there is an issue The input for this method points to an underscore. The input should only use one underscore. As the third position should be the beginning of the country code; the exception is thrown as it should. I couldn't find a problem This doesn't look like a problem because it is just a character being declared with a single character from the array. char ch3 = str. charAt(3); which is a 'P'. it passes the test for between A and Z; and does NOT throw that excpt'n This can't handle cases where the country code is omitted; but there are extensions in the locale string. ch3 would be ""_"" which is outside the range on line 115 ch3 is not setting off the conditions All it is doing at line 113 is stating that ch3 = '_'. The error happens later when checking the weight of the character. Line 114 was not the correct input Yes; if ""fr__POSIX"" has two underscores then the character at index 3 will lead to an exception being thrown. There is no issue While this line of code itself does not cause the error in this case it later causes the failure to occur. It grabs the character '_' for ch3; which is later checked to see if it is an uppercase letter. It is not; so the failure occurs. This is kind of a ""yes and no"" situation. Yes; the fact that the character in position 3; an underscore; is assigned to ch3 is directly responsible for this string passing the ensuing conditional check and throwing the exception at line 116. I say it is ""yes and no"" because arguably this line in and of itself is not an issue. The country code is missing. Or rather lines 115/117 are looking at '_P' and the underscore fails the validation. no issue The error is in the input to the method. There should not be an underscore char '_' at index 3 of the input  ch3 is an underscore; not an A-Z character. These lines of code tell it to throw an error when ch3 is not A-Z. YOU MAY HAVE output for the code is due to below statement. if (str. charAt(2) != '_') {                  throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid locale format: "" + str);              } A and Z need to be lower case. The exception is being thrown because of the third character in the test that was run. The underscore in ASCII is a greater than 'Z' value and is causing the code within the if statement to be executed. The issue seems to be in the formatting of the input; it must be separated by an underscore and be the correct length. The conditional clause between lines 115 and 117 is not related to the failure because no condition is met for the if statement to execute. This is because char ch3 is 'P' - which is not less than 'A' nor greater than 'Z' - and ch4 is 'O' - which is not less than 'A' nor greater than 'Z'. Lines 121 and 122 are related to the failure. Therefore; characters 3 and 4 represent the country code. In the test example given; the third character is an underscore (""_"") which is not allowed. Therefore; this code threw the proper exception letting the user know that the string input (""fr__POSIX"") was an incorrect format. LocaleUtils. toLocale(""fr__POSIX"") creates a Locale object. The parameter ""fr__POSIX"" is passed to the String str variable in line 94. Lines 115 to 117 are validating the fourth and fifth characters of str to ensure that these characters are uppercase letters. If not; it throws an IllegalArgumentException error. This is not the case as the values ""PO"" are valid uppercase letters. It is checking the 3rd and 4th characters are uppercase. The fourth character is an underscore. Write more descriptive errors next time. Upper case used for country code; So that the string is in invalid format that the result is IllegalArgumentException. syntax is correct None; this is an expected behavior of the code. This only means that the condition to check if the 3rd or 4th characters are invalid characters (non-alpha characters) in the locale value. no there is no issue. The comments say it validates strictly. There is no Country code. one could argue it's null I guess. There are consecutive underscores so ch3 is an underscore and not a Capital Letter so the exception is thrown at line 116. The if statement in line 115 is checking the character at locations 3 and 4; which in this case would be the fourth and fifth characters; ""_P"". It seems to be checking to make sure they are capital letters; which ch3 is not and rather is an underscore. Therefore either ch3 < 'A' or ch3 > 'Z' would return false; prompting the throwing of the IllegalArgumentException. There are other possibilities for this same exception to be thrown before line 116; but our string should pass those without any issues. ch3 will have a value (an underscore) that falls outside the range of 'A' through 'Z'."
