HIT01_8,"the variable should be defined as 'unsigned int' if we expect it to be always positive It will return the offset This is the argument exception thrown -15 is less then 0, so it throws IllegalArgumentException the conditional clause throws an error if the value of minutes is smaller than zero The second argument should be just 15 the code is incomplete The value of minutes offset does not have valid argument as a result this method will not be called as and argument exception will be displayed As noted in the comments, valid input for minutes must be in the rage -59 to +59 but on line 279 of the source minutesOffset is checked for < 0 The minute variable was negative therefore, it threw the exception because it only takes numbers between 0 and 59 for minutes Again the issue remains that the parameter check for minutes at line 279 doesn't allow negative numbers  and thus throws the exception Yes, the variable gets set to -15 through the arguments above This conditional will reject any negative minute input, even if the hour input is also negative this is also an int, which is a signed value Yes , this conditional clause is exactly the place from where the exception is thrown , because it is not in valid range of 'minutes' There is not an issue with this portion of the code, in fact this is where the exception we receive is thrown The variable 'minutesOffset' is checked incorrectly by the IF statement on line 279 There may be an issue as it involves not indigenous java In the code there is a check that 0 <= minutes < 60 and the minutesOffset is -15 which does not fall into these prarmeters thus throwing an Exception this cause assumes all negative minutes are bad Line 279 written as 'minutesOffset < 0' makes it clear it's the one throwing the Exception, as the -15 in the minutes spot is clearly less than 0 Yes, this line is exactly the one that produces the exception when minutesOffset is <0 yep, they are checking if minutesOffset < 0 to throw an exception, and as -15 <0, it gets thrown Minutes are set to -15, which is less then 0 and it throws illegal arg exception YES am not good in thus questanaire minutesOffset it is the offset in minutes from UTC, must be between 0 and 59 inclusive There is a logical check for if minuteOffset is less than 0 or greater than 59 causing it to throw an exception because the value is out of bounds (negative number) You are passing it a negative offset value (-15) and the conditionals are set to reject any offset that is less than 0 or greater than 59 and throw a new exception The definition seems fine to me According to the comments, the minute value should be between -59 and +59, but the conditional statement is checking for a value between 0 and 59 I believe the issue is with hoursOffset not minutes The code never gets that far This variable contains a value of -15 as set by DateTimeZone The argument -15 is less than 0, which causes the if statement conditional on line 279 to pass Value passed in minutes -15,where as it checks (<0 | >53) It's because of second line negative value There should be no issue with the variable minutesOffset, as it was declared properly and should not be related to the failure when it was being used in the correct manner The error is stemming from line 279 because the value of -15 for minutesOffset is < 0 DateTimeZone"
HIT02_24,"g is an integer, which is acceptable when creating a new Color object, as the arguments require integers I can only guess at the upper and lowerBound variables depending on the upperBound and lowerBound values, 'g' might exceed -255 or 255 which is not a valid value for the Color object g is the cast value of lb \ up - lb *255 no there is no issue There is a problem with the argument  public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument The argument value is checked against the lowerBound and upperBound variables, but the resulting variable v is never used in the code The color is out of the parameter should be between 0 the variable g is properly defined and used the argument value is defined correctly and used correctly It looks like the variable 'g' is being properly instantiated and the value it is being set to is being cast into an int While the variable 'g' may be out of range when passed to the Color constructor, it is being used correctly in this context There is nothing wrong with 'g' if you correctly sanitize 'value' Problem is that v is defined, but never actually used value really only has to be an int since valid values are forced 0 to 255 later value is a double and is used as a double in the method This does not appear to be an issue because a double is the default data type for decimals so this shouldn't be what is causing the error The variable is being defined correctly as a parameter of the getPaint method i believe that some error there in that line the variable 'g' is defined properly in the code yes I'm not sure if this is the issue but the fact that int g is being defined by (int) could be causing some kind of parameter error there is an issue with colors in that programme should be a float number The exception is coming from Color, so it must be g that has a bad value no You are calling the Color constructor with three float parameters so the values are allowed to be between 0 public class IllegalArgumentException extends RuntimeException thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument It's not clear if the program was meant to accept a negative number The variable 'value' is incorrectly used on line 117, where the variable 'v' should be used in its place Nothing in this method checks that the lower range of value is positive -- therefore a negative number is not sanitized The calculation of g appears to result in a negative integer value if the parameter value is negative to begin with g has to be 0-255 Since the exception seems to be thrown up by Color constructor (seeing message - color parameter outside of expected range), there is a problem with the value of g It's hard to give an answer based on this small amount of code for me variable 'g' might be outside the range of the Color class acceptable range values FFFFFFFFFFFDS FFFFFFFFFFFFF The variable value seems to be fine, the value of the integer g seems to be not acceptable to Color constructor, which is throwing the illegalArgumentException"
HIT03_6,"This is definitely where the problem is, but I'm not sure where While I am not sure exactly what this portion of the program is trying to accomplish I believe that there is a high likelihood that it could cause the program to crash Gotcha, I can number the lines now I don't see where this calls a method named translate I think you're incrementing 'pos' by two in line 89 then when it gets to 95 you're asking for the code point at position 2 but since there are only 2 positions, the highest address is 1 and that's why you're getting index out of bounds  The while loop has a potential to be infinite if the array c is null (I believe Java allows arrays of size 0) I cannot find an issue, but I am not sure The test that was run does not appear to be calling the method given below There is no reference to the variable 'pos' in the Exception The only place in the code where they are using arrays and dealing with array indexes, high probability of issue being present here I can't see an obvious problem This could throw the exception if pos exceeds len That line simply starts pos out at 0 Related 'pos' there won't be any issue,'pos' is an index to write char sequence to writer The error has to be in this block If the codePointAt method returns a unicode character value greater than 0x10000, then charCount returns 2, which would be potentially added to pos to create a larger index value than the string length if pos is null and len is greater than null then there will be a result The input '\uD83D\uDE30' needs to be passed through the Class StringEscapeUtils as well On line 95, there is a space between pos and += which I feel is the wrong syntax This method is not related to assertequals or stringescapeutils at all so it has no bearing, the issue will still be the Unicode escapes PT++ Should be PT+ The exception isn't being thrown by the source code below so it is occurring within a function that is being called in it The pos counter is being incremented in line 89 and line 95 within the while, so it could be incremented beyond the len variable (just copied my last statement since it applies here as well), StringEscapeUtils is a java constructor with the method escapeCsv, translate isn't even being used at all in the assertion charCount,codePointAt determines the number of char values needed to represent the specified character I think this is a valid for loop, I am not very sure what line 95 is saying though On line 85, a recursive call is made to the function with an improper number of arguments and expecting a return value Why is this recursive? Unnecessarily complicated have not come across the data type, pos Ok I get it, it is an issue with index numbers being less than the length This for loop will terminate properly, but it is unclear whether or not the 'pos' variable will have a valid value by the end of the loop I don't have idea Yes, there is an exception with surrogate pairs, so there is an issue in line 95 which deals with surrogate pairs I think Checking a character in the string with pos most likely causes an error since the error is a string out of bounds looks fine to me there is a start and end to each for-loop That variable is not correct Think So No The Pos variable is the index variable to array begging There's no issue with the pos variable on the error the for loop is limited up to the value of consumed, while pos is incremented, possibly past the end of input since there are no check conditions as pos gets larger, it will go past CharSequence at given (input, pos) The issue is not in the pos variable, but in the len which tells the pos how far to go pos is trying to add to itself via charcount of an input that is out of range I just don't see it I'm a little fuzzy on what is going on with this code because I'm not up on all the details of handling unicode but the purpose of this sections seems to be dealing with the fact that in things like UTF-8 sometimes you get characters that are one byte and sometimes 2 Error is in line in lines 85-88 pt can go out of range of the array pos will always be less than length, so the code should run The test doesn't use the related source code I don't notice anything This appears to be an incremental loop that doesn't have any errors in it the variable 'pos' holds an integer value while the error deals with a call for the 3rd character in a String that only has 2 characters This looks correct no mistake with that variable pos in the source code Could not find the solution Possibly You are simply initializing pos to be equal to 0 The invocation will call to inspect the input at positions that are out of range (pos) Yes As I said in my previous answer, I'm pretty sure the issue is with one of the Character It seems like a simple increment on the pos variable The Int pt variable value is reach out of the consumed the exception accoutered Syntax is correct, it does not lead to string index out of range failure The instantiation of the integer value pos is not at issue The function is not called there This could be the cause of the exception It might if the position it returns in the string isn't accessible Calling the translate method with in it's body According to the syntax, there is no issue, but need to check with any  an illegal arguments from the complete program This code is probably the cause of the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error lines 84-97 reference character counts, which seems much more correlated to the concept in the failure of being out of range There is no code to prevent pt++ from exceeding len (where len = input I dont know because some of the values are not given in this function code sometimes may that can lead to a run time bug I don't believe it is even reaching that section of code, I believe the error to be somewhere in the while loop depending on the input, the 'pos' could be longer than the length of the input Not an expert but it would throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException rather than StringIndexOutOfBoundsException I would have thought, though the codePointAt is array processing I'm not sure exactly what is going on given the example code provided, but nothing in the block throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException It doesn't look like there's any indexing going on there"
HIT04_7,"There would be an issue cause the function add uses the updatebound with different var type You initialise count to 0, then you never change that value e is referencing minMiddleIndex instead of maxMiddleIndex on line 301 division with 0 does not work I am not sure I beleive the getTime will cause a problem, because you are trying to set s to be variable of type 'long', and getTime is going to return a time value e is of type Long, which matches what is needed or can be cast appropriately I am not familiar enough with some of the functions used to know if there is an issue Code in and around line 301 contains a bug wherein minMiddleIndex is used instead of maxMiddleIndex, will result in a wrong maxMiddleIndex in general The variable e is used in two locations which are both reachable by the program (because both minMiddleIndex and maxMiddleIndex are values that can both evaluate to greater than 0) and it can be changed unintentionally You would presumably want the end to refer to maxMiddleIndex The issue is probably at line 304 Not aware of this error The failure is caused by the fact that an assertion test was set to 1 on an index fetch on the one time period added to the TimePeriodValues long maxMiddle = s + (e - s) / 2,              if (middle > maxMiddle) {                  this You're initializing assertEquals to believe the count will be one, while the actual count is three No issues that I can see I'm not familiar with Java this I don't think there should be any issue cause of e for above code When we are calculating maxMiddleIndex the value to be considered should be   long e = getDataItem(this Cannot see the method getMaxMiddleIndex(), so unsure of what is happening variable 'e' is used as a conditional to determine maxMiddleIndex I feel the expression in e should be changed to find a max middle index Simple implication being performed here e is the time in milliseconds I can not determine any issue with the method invocations on line 301 In the initialization of e and s, the parameters for getDataItem is this The issue is before these lines as it does not have the correct assumption for the middle index There are errors throughout this code s should be defined as long s = getDataItem(this I cannot see the getPeriod(), getStart(), or getTime() methods using minMiddleMindex there I can't figure out how to calculate the s No clue, only thing I can think is to throw new There is nothing wrong with the declaration or assignment of this variable The function getMaxMiddleIndex() seems to be the problem and I don't see it in this code ??!! both s and e are Long!  maybe just me, but this confuses (play with 's')! There is no TimePeriodValues in pgm It doesn't seem like there's an issue with line 301, when line 287 is the exact same thing i dont know how I am expected to know the outcome of this program without the code for the function getmaxmiddleindex I'm going to assume TimePeriodValues have a constructor that takes a String and first line is okay The method invocation looks normal NO COMMENTS I dont think anything unusual here the if conditions and the functions are in correct semantic manner The code may be the reason for the failure Line 301 is calling assessor functions to set variables to be used to calculate the MaxMiddleIndex The tested code only adds one TimePeriod to the TimePeriodValues instance and therefore updateBounds is only called once at that point low version jdk not support From looking at the source code, perhaps you would want to check with the getDataItem parameter At line 299, it should be 'getDataItem(this I don't see why it would cause the error Error: Could not find or load main class undefined I do not know what is causing this failure This call-chain is consistent with other lines that call the same This method doesn't have issues related the failure on the initialization, that section of code should not be entered as  this The code is working in those areas, there are checks inplace to make sure the number is above 0 Variable is different Seems like the right way to do it, but I may not have enough context s Well, since I cannot see how 'getDataItem' is defined within the class, I am not sure if it is throwing that error or not At line 299, variable 's' is declared which contributes to setting 'maxMiddleIndex' At line 301 the argument of 'getDataItem' should be 'this i tested and i checked In the code, in the previous if, you are checking whether maxIndex is greater than 0, but then using MinIndex(L 298) Presumably the recalculate method is called during initialization or at the very least the indexes are set to -1 at initialization The method call on line 299 and on line 301 are being invocated on the wrong object line number 299-302 should be like below :     long s = getDataItem(this There do not appear to be errors with the clause line 299 should be:      long s = getDataItem(this Yes, since the method invocations are part of an expression to get the value for variable e where its result impacts the value to set for the maxMiddleIndex variable no ideas There might be an error that makes the MaxMiddleIndex take the value of the index and cause the assertion failure I don't know i think, instead of 3 middle index is returned from this part of the code You want to check for maxMiddleIndex to see if its value makes sense with the updated bounds parameter for s is already set for 3 but expected value 1 so there is an issue I believe that the line should use this The code there is fine There very well could be an issue in this variable definition, although I am not sure specifically what it would be Difficult to point out we are doing assertEquals(1, s it is very easy to execute the code and get the output As far as I can tell there shouldn't be an issue but that section is the only section in the code shown that deals with MaxMiddleIndex which is what the failure is caused by I do not see a viable issue right away There does not seem to be an issue with the getDataItem, getTime, getEnd, get Period, and they seem to be in the correct order for an operation like that to happen Is middle defined? it not contion in the version of jdk The definition of the variable had nothing to do with the error I'm not this familiar with java There appears to be missing code there is no clear invocation of functions I really can't find the problem with the incovation programming skill public void add(TimePeriodValue item) wont get invoked since it takes only one argument whereas the test s I believe it should be dealing with the maxMiddleIndex While by convention you should use easy to read names, the variable is being declared in conditional clauses that will not run at the same time 3"
HIT05_35,"I do not know enough about arrays in JAVA to know if the failure is related i think new array value going to be null in this program , it may be a cause of error the method public static Object[] add(Object[] array, Object element) Copies the given array and adds the given element at the end of the new array Cannot establish relationship of 'test' with the 'source code' Because a new object array is being copied to a string type array some elements of the array could not be cast appropriately The double ternary operator and the 'type = array != null' part are very confusing and hard to figure out no there is no issue I believe it is the casting at 3290 that is the issue as copyArrayGrow1 returns an object Since the inputs are null, then return is an array of [null] the creation of the new object array newArray copying the old array seems to be fine and not directly related to the ClassCastException ArrayUtils While the Class type is correct, and the syntax is how type should be defined, the value that was returned by copyArrayGrow1 is an Object rather than a string element != null ? element Yes, this is related to the failure (though not where the failure actually occurs) Same concept here you are trying to cast an object to an array and you are not allowed to do so No There should not be T() before the newArray I don't think there's a problem as Class<?> can represent a Class object of any type Type of the variable 'type' may be incompatible If array is null and element is null it sets type to object class The declaration of newArray fails when it is null as in the example The type variable being used at line 3290 is set up at line 3288 No because type is a generic class that can be set to anything it should implicit cast to the type of the object returned I can see that ' T[] newArray = (T[]) copyArrayGrow1(array, type),' copies an array and adds the given elements to said array, but I'm unsure with the variable declared above the template ends up with the class being type of string and the result is string[] It doesn't have any logic to make sure BOTH cases don't fail (and thus one can be null type will be object when it should be string type will end up being a class object after this example there is no issue Not very sure, but the failure involves an object trying to be assigned to a String The code is passing the class type as null newArray is not a reserved name and the copyArrayGrowl method appears to return an Object of type Array, which is the cast to T[] which matches the newArray type No, it appears to be used as intended Both the first conditional statment and nested conditional statement are false, therefore the line sets the variable type=Object We are passing Null values I think that the array and string being null is likely to cause a problem in this case Doesn't seem wrong Yes, type gets set to Object when both parameters to add are null which is what causes the ClassCastException The type should be directly inferred from the Template argument types new array and copyArrayGrowl are different types, cannot equal each other I THINK THIS ANSWERS No troubles with the conditional, it's doing its job properly, its the casting thats causing the issue Yes, as with the previous problems 'type' gets set to the Object class when both 'array' and 'element' are null I think this could be answered 'Yes' or 'No' legitimately There is no issue with the definition of the variable 'type' that I can see You need to change the method to throw IllegalArgumentException when both parameters are null I do not believe Class<?> type in line 3288 is responsible for the failure because by writing Class<?>, you are declaring a Class object which can be of any type (? being a wildcard), and the failure is related to an object being casted as a string <?> is not defined The inferred type for the array is Object I see no reason why the line of code in question should lead to an IllegalArgumentException I believe the error is likely to be somewhere in this line given that the failure is a class cast exception and this is the line where the classes are being retrieved There is an issue with this line, but it's because the type variable is set incorrectly on line 3288 That was my first impression, that the use of generics enforces type, and the copyArrayGrow1 method should return an object of type array, or the code will break It is valid nested conditional clause,which getClass() depends on whether array!=null or null ya it may be the reason but not clearly say the failure accoutered if the data interchange between two differed datatype variables if its not portable well the generic is recognized to be a String type by the jvm but then the type value is Object I don't know, as I need the complete program I don't think 'type' is a reserved word in Java As mentioned before, we need to first verify that array parm is not null before using getClass on it so that there will be an instance that allows getClass to work"
HIT06_51,"The comparison between (long)x == x could cause an error since x is still a double value would be a long, which does not have a decimal place, that is what was happening in the error (long)x will cast double to long I don't know what the 'add()' method does for sure, but it seems to only build strings This could be the problem but I suspect the issue is either on line 248 or 263 Correct the while loop if pretty print call addNumber with -0 There are no conditional clause issues to string returns string in exponential notation format The lines 257 to 261 are fine in the context of addNumber method written The conditional is correct and the logic seems to be fine Yes there is I do not think this clause would cause the failure we see, it is concerned with converting a value to scientific notation, but I do not think it could result in a value of negative 0 It is not an issue with the code it is an issue with your saved file and you have to open it up and add a space or line and resave and the problem should go away the clause checks out as fine legally and morally They all had values with successful conversion to string The if-else block on line 257-261 seems correct It is valid add method just converts the String to Long and adds the specified value No issues i now see what the add method at the bottom See previous answer This is on comparison of two obviously non-null strings, for example assertEquals('a', 'b') The conditional statement should have no issue since the variable 'exp' is declared and initialized in the same namespace, and is an integer a parsePrint method is used on the value to be compared (var x = -0 I still don't see x getting defined correctly here The comparisons seem to be fine add method not preceded by class name or defined above I don't really understand what is going at this part of the code The conditional looks good The conditional clause identified is not involved in the error being produced Could not understand the test case but since most of the processing is happening in this code block so it is probable No code in here calls parsePrint Yes I think so there was a syntax error The highlighted if statement relates to the treatment of large numbers, not decimals I don't believe so - (long)x will be equal to x for -0 line 260 is not changing the value of x and thus is not related to the failure of x not being the expected value I believe 'E' within the clause is resulting to the failure I doubt this line is relevant either the method parsePrint is not invoked as I see from the given code no issue found comparison was proper I think so, addbstring converts the null message to the String 'null' may be I am wrong Could not establish relationship between the 'test' and the 'source code' The problem is that a [-0 I believe that the problem must be in the add method As aforementioned, your flow isn't pushing into this code if I'm not mistaken - where is the parsePrint method here? As for the mantissa calc stuff, that kind of logic always blows me unless I get it running with some numbers and think it out real hard When parsing string 'var x = -0 value is properly converted to a string before being passed into the function there is no issue in getting the last character The method being called in the test is parsePrint, which is not included in the source code nor the functions that are call or are called by the source code listed It's possible that there could be an issue there, depending on the value of 'value', but chances are the issue with that line would actually come into play at line 248, instead of line 260 the exp variable not get the value is unusable function so the code not executed allways this code is unrelated to the comparison failure, it only adds a number to a string not exactly a problem with that code section but there seems to be an improper parsing of a negative zero fractional portion earlier in the code I am not sure if Long I am still not sure what could be causing the failure The error is in the while loop within the clause which will never be able to exit the loop, for the same reasons I wrote in the first question All of the conditionals appear to be functioning correctly and don't have a direct association with the method being called in the test"
HIT07_33,"I do not believe there is any issue with how array is used but I am not sure A NullPointerException occurs in Java the same as in any other language in that you're pushing something that is valued at null into something that either cannot accept it as such or cannot use it as such and then having it be used incorrectly - with the null value All this section is doing is that it is passing in the array that is given during runtime - the error does not occur here I don't believe there is an issue yes the classes is the set type and the array is the object type so the type conversion is not possible it the reason for the failure I'm not sure if the Again, I think it's okay if you add the conditional check in I referred to in the previous 2 answers These lines are just a recursion until the end of the array The issue is actually with the use of one of the members of the array variable Yes, I think that the NullPointerException is thrown when getClass() not defined The error seems to be dependent on what is passed into the function and not the definition of the variable 'array' The FOR loop should check if the element (array[i]) is null there is no issue in the getClass line in the source code []array should be [array] The array is not classified correctly The array is being declared and pointing to an object, but the object is defined as null I think when it gets to array[i] when I is 1 i++ should be i+ Trying to get the class of a null object will throw a nullpointexception NO it is not reason to the failure the it can able to store any type of data's in java There will not be any failure, Iterating set of classes and returning set of classes a null check should be included here The second element of our input array is null The getClass method is being used correctly and the array is populated with Objects The error would have occurred earlier as it should not have made it to this point if the array was null The variable 'array' seems to be defined and used correctly, but I am not 100 percent certain The for-loop dereferences members of the array without first checking whether they're null (this is the issue I was referring to before, though it's not technically with the variable 'array the getClass() method cannot read from null! the template isn't expecting a null pointer - but that's what is being passed in! The for-loop looks correct, it doesn't seem to be the cause The definition and use of the variable array look fine putting classes into a class array, no error there I believe index 1 in the array being looped through is a null, so this would cause an exception since getClass expects an object, not null Everything seems ok It looks like array is being properly declared as a variable here and that shouldn't be causing a problem the method public static Class<?>[] toClass(Object Not sure if it's possible, but it could be because you're trying to do get class on null at array position 1 Is the code not create an array of objects named 'Class'? Why invite confusion since you're not creating a new class, but objects named Class It may be that the getClass at line 910 is attempting to access a null value as if it was not null usage of array variable doesnot leads to null pointer exception No, absolutely not input for the method is passed with null,     new Class[]{String getClass() method not defined It is trying to grab the intValue within the program but because there is not one you get the Exception The second element of the array is null (which has no class), and the getClass method with produce a NullPointerException in this case While it seems like a perfectly reasonable for-loop that walks through the passed array and adds it to the class array, I suspect it is the problem with how Objects are technically handled through Java An object is being passed as an array as a parameter in toClass, so this shouldn't cause the exception Declared and used properly As we iterate through Object's dimensions, there are null arrays in the middle The for loop itself looks fine there does not seem to be a problem I want to say the error of the NullPointerException is caused by these lines of code, as this is where you finally call on the array object, after checking to see if the object itself is null or empty the loop seems to me ok as per my understanding Yes because the line is trying to get the class of a null object it looks fine to me Presumably, in order to run the code it has to compile and to compile it has to type check There should be some code that says that if array[i] == null, to not attempt to getClass() and just class[i] = null, I think that getClass could produce a null pointer error if it were applied to a null, however, I don't see how that would work with this code"
HIT08_54,"both the variable ch3 and ch4 defined correctly, I think there is not an issue Not an issue The exception is being thrown because of the third character in the test that was run Yes, if 'fr__POSIX' has two underscores then the character at index 3 will lead to an exception being thrown The fourth character must be the beginning of the country code per the defined format for the string version of locale Yes else statement is missing The country code is missing THERE IS no there is no issue Given that the format of the locale appears to be cc__CCCCC (c for character), the third character of the locale will always contain an underscore It is checking the 3rd and 4th characters are uppercase Not per se as the length is fine according to the validation char ch3 = str This is kind of a 'yes and no' situation LocaleUtils The issue seems to be in the formatting of the input, it must be separated by an underscore and be the correct length The if statement in line 115 is checking the character at locations 3 and 4, which in this case would be the fourth and fifth characters, '_P' YOU MAY HAVE Line 114 was not the correct input We still have the problem from line 115 with ch3 not being a-z, but if that weren't the problem, then line 121-122 would cause the failure as well None,this is an expected behavior on the code I couldn't find a problem ch3 is not setting off the conditions All it is doing at line 113 is stating that ch3 = '_' I don't think there is an issue There is no issue code condition at 110 is throwing exception The input for this method points to an underscore output for the code is due to below statement A and Z need to be lower case ch3 is an underscore, not an A-Z character The format is invalid according to the explanation at the top (should be fr_POSIX), so this error should be thrown None, this is an expected behavior of the code In this example, the exception is still thrown based on the conditional statement at line 115 The comments say it validates strictly This can't handle cases where the country code is omitted, but there are extensions in the locale string The conditional clause between lines 115 and 117 is not related to the failure because no condition is met for the if statement to execute they should have specified for each length specifically ch3 would be '_' which is outside the range on line 115 The input 'fr__POSIX' is not following the expected format outlined in the javadoc: the fourth character is part of the country code and 'must be uppercase' (not an underscore) This doesn't look like a problem because it is just a character being declared with a single character from the array syntax is correct ch3 is fine, but will error on line 115 when we try to verify ch3 is a capital letter (it's an underscore) Line 115 invalid case ch3, ch4 checks if the country code are in capital letters or not ch3 will have a value (an underscore) that falls outside the range of 'A' through 'Z' no issue Upper case used for country code, So that the string is in invalid format that the result is IllegalArgumentException Again as the last question, the input is in the wrong format and therefore the program correctly throws an error The output result is Language code in lowercase and Countrycode in Uppercase in between separator use underscore The failure occurs during the execution of lines 115 - 116 this is the same problem as last time in line 115, if (ch3 > 'A' || ch3 < 'Z' || ch4 >'A' || ch4 < 'Z') ch3 is assigned a '_' value The str variable must be the correct length and start with two lowercase letters, which can be followed by an underscore, two uppercase letters, another underscore, and three lowercase letters While this line of code itself does not cause the error in this case it later causes the failure to occur I don't think so variable 'ch3' is a cause of failure , its a simple declaration The error is in the input to the method"
