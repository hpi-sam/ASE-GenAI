Line 294 is not where the exception is thrown because the code never reaches that point.

The DateTimeZone method calls the forOffsetMillis method in line 294 which is after the IllegalArgumentException error occurs. This error points to the minuteOffset value being too small or too big; meaning that is not withn the range of 0 to 59. In this case;the minuteOffset value is -15 as set by invoking DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2; -15)).,1,1,78cA-9e4a2-6-7,5,Hobbyist,1.0,30,1,1000,7,0,100
