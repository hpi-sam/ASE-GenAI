When coding in my Python class; we were first provided with the test cases; and a short block of code containing assertions. It is a very helpful tool. However; once I had to start writing my own test cases; it became a game of making sure whether or not I had EVERY possible test case. (Which is kind of scary; since I always felt I had to be leaving something out). Writing assertions is necessary; though!

The source code provided doesn't quite match the code that is being tested; at least since we only get to look at the version of add() method with one parameter; while in the tested code we have s.add taking two arguments. So it's hard to predict what that 3.0 stands for. However; the obvious typo that is present in the source code provided; that might very well be the cause of the failure; is in lines 299 and 301. In this segment of the code we're dealing with maxMiddleIndex and should really be getting values for our calculations from this.maxMiddleIndex; not this.minMiddleIndex. Because of this typo what we're actually doing is checking whether the middle value of our currently processed time period is greater than the middle value of the time period with the lowest middle value; which is incoherent with our logic and is sure to cause invalid results.,10,4,845EI-3g-3E700,5,Undergraduate_Student,6.0,21,0,100,0,3,174
