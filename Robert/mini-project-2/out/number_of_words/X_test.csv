809,3,97.675,4,2,0,3,10,3,4,1,1.0,31,1,1050,0,1,18,0,The argument deals with maxMiddleIndex and the lines between 262 and 271 deal with the minStartIndex variable. 
2356,7,75.948,4,2,0,2,3,3,5,0,15.0,29,0,50,1,6,24,0,At this point; str.charAt(2) = _ (underscore); which fulfills the requirement of the if-statement on line 110; and therefore the exception is not thrown.
761,3,163.008,3,3,0,3,1,1,5,0,7.0,35,0,1050,3,2,6,0,No there is definitely no issue.
318,1,162.658,4,5,0,1,1,4,3,1,5.0,30,1,1000,3,1,4,0,This is valid statement.
961,3,138.103,4,4,0,2,13,4,5,0,3.0,25,0,1000,3,2,11,0,The method getMaxMiddleIndex doesn't get called in the given source code
2566,7,2913.806,4,2,0,1,1,1,3,1,10.0,40,1,1000,0,4,114,0,"The test failed because ""fr__POSIX"" doesn't conform to one of the three required formats (described on lines 74;75; and 76). It fails the validation check on line 115 because variable ""ch3"" (the 4th letter in the string) is required to be an uppercase letter; whereas in the test string (""fr__POSIX"") ""ch3"" is an underscore.     I think the program is working as expected -- it's catching invalid strings and telling you so; although the error message is; in my opinion; a bit cryptic.    I don't see a problem with the code; unless I'm missing something. I would need to do more testing to rate myself as ""Very sure""."
2493,7,344.011,0,3,1,1,8,8,4,0,9.0,30,0,50,0,2,40,0,The locale string does not meet the proper format. It is not five characters so execution branches to the else clause in which the string fails to contain an underscore at the fifth character position so an exception is thrown.
1688,5,111.344,5,2,2,2,18,7,5,0,20.0,33,0,1000,3,1,9,1,Correct the while loop. The problem will be solved.
1510,4,73.64,5,1,0,2,1,1,3,0,2.0,18,0,1150,1,1,24,1,This issue is not related to the core issue; which is that the method copyArrayGrow1 is returning an Object rather than a string. 
2048,6,111.521,2,3,2,2,3,3,5,0,5.0,32,0,1000,1,1,25,1,I'm not sure if the .getClass() call is actually calling anything that is defined in the programming. This could potentially be causing a null exception.
2395,7,167.233,3,5,0,2,1,1,5,0,1.0,34,0,50,12,1,16,1,both the variable ch3 and ch4 defined correctly; I think there is not an issue 
1055,3,148.308,3,3,0,2,2,1,5,0,2.0,27,0,1000,3,2,25,0,ya the get Time getEnd get Period; getDataItem is the objects or part of the class it not access to the long var  
1750,5,36.014,4,2,0,2,1,1,5,0,3.0,24,0,1100,3,1,10,0,There seems to be no issue here. It works fine.
1550,4,1255.645,0,5,1,1,1,1,3,1,1.0,25,1,1000,1,1,100,1,"I can see that "" T[] newArray = (T[]) copyArrayGrow1(array; type);"" copies an array and adds the given elements to said array; but I'm unsure with the variable declared above.  The variable ""type"" is taken as an argument in declaring ""newArray"" and the variable is cast into type ""T[]"" that the two class variables must not be compatible. I'm honestly rather confused by ""Class<?> type = array != null ? array.getClass() : (element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class);"" In having an unknown class it seems that the method might not work with multiple unknowns. But I'm rather unsure."
1211,3,850.044,5,4,2,1,1,1,4,0,2.0,24,0,1000,6,2,14,0,If we use asserarrayequals instead of arrayequals then it will not give an error.
530,2,1234.548,3,4,0,3,6,3,5,0,10.0,53,0,1000,3,1,25,0,I think there is no problem with lines 86-91 associated  with the given test; since the lines do not deal with surrogate pairs. 
289,1,322.857,0,5,1,2,1,1,4,0,35.0,59,0,1050,1,1,47,1,I can only guess at the upper and lowerBound variables. the code doesn't seem to care if the value passed is negative though otherwise it appears to be trying to force g in the range of 0 to 255 as an int. that might be a problem
2207,7,63.793,5,1,0,3,1,1,4,0,10.0,27,0,1050,0,4,11,0,ch0 = 'f' and 'f' > 'a' and 'f' < 'z'
2313,7,896.985,4,3,0,2,20,15,3,1,1.0,34,1,1000,3,1,17,1,The output result is Language code in lowercase and Countrycode in Uppercase in between separator use underscore.
1134,3,700.279,1,3,2,1,1,1,4,0,22.0,37,0,1150,0,7,75,1,"Well; since I cannot see how ""getDataItem"" is defined within the class; I am not sure if it is throwing that error or not.  Plus; I don't see where there could be a try ... catch block that could throw the AssertionFailedError.  It could be something in the ""getDataItem"" method or one of the subsequent stacked method calls that are after it.  There is truly not enough code to make a decision."
