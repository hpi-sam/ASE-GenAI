2078,6,261.831,4,2,0,1,1,3,4,1,9.0,33,1,1000,12,1,40,0,integer i is assigned a initial value of zero and it increments till the end of array.Also in line 903 array is checked for null value .Hence the declaration of variable i may not result in null pointer exception. 
2312,7,84.939,5,1,2,2,20,15,5,0,2.0,29,0,1150,1,2,22,1,this is the same problem as last time..... line 115 is not going to like the 4th character being an underscore. 
1001,3,21.95,4,2,0,2,2,2,3,0,23.0,44,0,1100,1,2,48,0,s.getMaxMiddleIndex() is 3 by the time it gets to the assertEquals test rather than the expected value of 1. Problem is lines 299 and 301 where minMiddleIndex is used accidentally. Classic copy paste error. There may be another issue of course. Can't tell without fixing that glaring one.
2243,7,103.11,3,3,0,3,1,1,5,1,5.0,23,1,1100,1,1,48,0,No I do not believe there is an issue with this particular line because it just checks to make sure ch1 is a lowercase letter; which it should be as the language code. The str.charAt(1) is the correct way of finding that position 1 character in the string.
1232,3,1486.719,3,4,0,1,3,2,4,1,7.0,32,1,1000,1,3,9,0,The expected does not match the actual.Hence the error.
1252,3,341.944,0,5,1,1,10,4,4,0,10.0,20,0,1150,0,2,30,0,I honestly can't tell what's supposed to be going on in this code because I can't see all of your methods like getMaxMiddleIndex or even just the constructor for SimpleTimePeriod.
338,2,39.985,5,5,0,1,1,1,4,0,1.0,29,0,1000,5,1,4,0,Their is no issue
1719,5,132.173,5,2,0,2,1,1,3,0,4.0,30,0,1050,22,3,13,0,because value variable is a keyword; possible it will create failure of program
454,2,214.53,4,1,0,3,1,2,4,0,3.0,28,0,50,4,2,42,0,I'd assume input.length() would come to 12 in this instance; and pos should increment 1 each pass; for each char. Less than is properly used in the loop; so that 0-11 will run; for 12 passes. I see no issue with this.
1978,6,274.026,5,1,0,1,5,3,5,0,32.0,48,0,1150,0,7,51,0,"The Object array being passed in contains a null element; but the list itself is not null. Therefore the code highlighted will not have a problem. ""array==null"" will just evaluate to false; then array.length will not be 0. Accessing array.length will not cause an exception since the array does contain elements."
1363,3,680.163,4,2,0,1,2,2,5,0,20.0,35,0,1100,4,2,24,0,All of these methods should be defined for the referenced data structures and they are only called if a data item exists at maxEndIndex.
2218,7,52.973,5,1,0,3,1,1,4,0,2.0,21,0,1000,1,1,19,0,There is no issue with the declaration. As I said before; check your conditionals in lines 115 and 121.
410,2,258.274,3,5,2,1,1,1,5,0,6.0,26,0,1000,12,1,17,0,Ok I get it; it is an issue with index numbers being less than the length 
1686,5,100.866,1,5,0,2,18,7,3,0,14.0,37,0,1050,30,1,11,1,"Could not establish relationship between the ""test"" and the ""source code"""
1992,6,97.366,4,4,0,3,3,3,4,0,3.0,30,0,50,13,1,22,0,These lines are just saying that if the array is empty (has a length of 0); to return an empty lass array.
659,2,82.741,2,5,0,1,1,1,3,0,2.0,22,0,1000,1,0,7,0,Error is in line in lines 85-88
750,3,401.687,4,3,0,3,1,1,4,0,35.0,42,0,1100,1,3,73,0,line 259 is very simple and there's no way for it to be wrong assuming that the methods involved are being invoked correctly; but without being given a definition of getEnd() and getTime() there's no way for me to evaluate that; we have to assume that period is not null; that getEnd() returns some object that has a getTime() method; and that getTime() returns something that can be properly converted into a long
1110,3,257.888,5,5,0,1,13,4,5,0,4.0,25,0,1000,3,1,31,0,public void add(TimePeriodValue item) wont get invoked since it takes only one argument whereas the test s.add(new SimpleTimePeriod(0L; 50L); 3.0) has two arguments here; so it means issue is somewhere else.
1479,4,352.132,4,2,2,2,1,1,4,0,12.0,27,0,1150,0,3,109,0,"Yes; this is related to the failure (though not where the failure actually occurs). The logic here first checks the array type if it's not null; but because the array is null in our case; it sets ""type"" to a basic Object type. This value gets passed to copyArrayGrowl() which returns a copy of the array.     The ""type"" that's set in this line would usually be a backup value in case the array is null; but since the array is both null and the ""type"" value passed is a basic Object type; the array that's returned is an Object[] array; causing the failure later on."
